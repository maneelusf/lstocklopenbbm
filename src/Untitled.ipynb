      "Risk FactorsThe Company’ s business, reputation, results of operations, financial condition and stock price can be affected by a number of factors, whether currently known or unknown, including those described in Part I, Item 1A of the 2022 Form 10-K under the heading“ Risk Factors.”EuropeEurope net sales decreased during the first quarter of 2023 compared to the same quarter in 2022 due to the weakness in foreign currencies relative to the U. S. dollar, which contributed to lower net sales of iPhone and Mac.The weakness of the renminbi contributed to lower net sales of iPhone, which was partially offset by higher net sales of iPad. JapanJapan net sales decreased during the first quarter of 2023 compared to the same quarter in 2022 due to the weakness of the yen relative to the U. S. dollar, which contributed to lower net sales of Services and Mac.MacMac net sales decreased during the first quarter of 2023 compared to the same quarter in 2022 due primarily to lower net sales of MacBook Pro ®.iPadiPad net sales increased during the first quarter of 2023 compared to the same quarter in 2022 due primarily to higher net sales of iPad and iPad Air ®.Apple Inc. | Q 1 2023 Form 10-Q | 17 Wearables, Home and AccessoriesWearables, Home and Accessories net sales decreased during the first quarter of 2023 compared to the same quarter in 2022 due primarily to lower net sales of AirPods, partially offset by higher net sales of Watch.ServicesServices net sales increased during the first quarter of 2023 compared to the same quarter in 2022 due primarily to higher net sales from cloud services, the App Store ® and music.Gross MarginProducts and Services gross margin and gross margin percentage for the three months ended December 31, 2022 and December 25, 2021 were as follows (dollars in millions): Products Gross MarginProducts gross margin decreased during the first quarter of 2023 compared to the same quarter in 2022 due primarily to the weakness in foreign currencies relative to the U. S. dollar and lower Products volume.Services Gross MarginServices gross margin increased during the first quarter of 2023 compared to the same quarter in 2022 due primarily to higher Services net sales, partially offset by the weakness in foreign currencies relative to the U. S. dollar.Services gross margin percentage decreased during the first quarter of 2023 compared to the same quarter in 2022 due primarily to the weakness in foreign currencies relative to the U. S. dollar and higher Services costs, partially offset by improved leverage.Business Seasonality and Product IntroductionsThe Company has historically experienced higher net sales in its first quarter compared to other quarters in its fiscal year due in part to seasonal holiday demand.Services net sales also include amortization of the deferred value of services bundled in the sales price of certain products. iPhoneiPhone net sales decreased during the first quarter of 2023 compared to the same quarter in 2022 due primarily to lower net sales from the Company’ s new iPhone models launched in the fourth quarter of 2022.The Company’ s effective tax rate for the first quarter of 2023 was lower compared to the same quarter in 2022 due primarily to a higher U. S. federal R & D credit, lower state income taxes and a lower effective tax rate on foreign earnings, largely offset by lower tax benefits from share-based compensation.\n",
