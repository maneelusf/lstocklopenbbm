REUTERS/Joshua RobertsWASHINGTON, April 21 (Reuters) - U.S. Federal Reserve officials remain set to raise interest rates at their May 2-3 meeting but key data between now and then, particularly a survey of bank lending officers, may shape how they weight the risks facing the U.S. economy and whether they decide to pause further increases.Since the March 21-22 meeting Fed officials say they have kept in close touch with bank executives and contacts in other industries to gauge how the dramatic collapse of Silicon Valley Bank on March 10 affected the willingness of financial firms to provide credit to businesses and households, and try to gauge if bigger problems threatened.The increased monitoring has included daily checks on liquidity, Fed officials said, and a drive to be sure all banks had the paperwork ready to borrow quickly from different Fed facilities should it be necessary - signs of how seriously top central bankers viewed the collapse of SVB and the smaller Signature Bank.However the fallout since then has been muted enough that Fed officials, in their final comments before a pre-meeting blackout period begins on Saturday, have swung their focus back to persistently high inflation and the need for at least one more quarter point interest rate increase.Overall bank credit did fall about 1.5% in the three weeks from Wednesday, March 15 to Wednesday April 5, and there were initial outflows of deposits from smaller banks to larger ones. But those flows quickly stabilized, and the Fed's recent Beige Book compendium of observations about the economy showed the lending impact seemingly regionalized, not evolving into an imminent national credit crash."There was some turbulence...and it kind of worked itself out," Atlanta Fed President Raphael Bostic said in an interview with Reuters of the time following the SVB collapse. "Our team started asking bankers lots of questions. Are you seeing deposits leave? Are you getting elevated calls?...There was heightened alert."But Bostic said when he asked staff if they'd heard anything out of the norm, the response was "no, we really haven't."Similar comments have come from across the Fed system in recent weeks, with an attitude of wariness and a more intense information flow followed by a sense that the worst problems seem to have been avoided.Investors in federal funds futures have followed that by raising their own expectation the U.S. central bank will follow through with its tenth consecutive rate hike. The quarter point increase expected at the May meeting would raise the benchmark interest rate to the range, between 5% and 5.25%, that Fed policymakers projected in both December and March would likely be the peak for the current round of policy tightening.Reuters Graphics Reuters GraphicsInvestors are also betting, in large part, that the next rate hike will in fact be the last one, despite an increasingly muddled situation in which some of the information central to the Fed's debate won't be publicly available until after the meeting.The headline data since the Fed's last meeting has pointed to developing economic weakness and provided reasons to think inflation will slow. Indeed Fed Board of Governors staff at the March meeting of the Federal Open Market Committee projected a "mild recession" would begin later this year.At the same time, hiring remained strong through March, and wages continue growing faster than Fed officials feel is sustainable. Inflation remains so persistent across important areas of the service industry that one influential policymaker, Fed Governor Christopher Waller, heads into the meeting having declared progress on inflation "more or less stalled."The Fed will receive updated information next Friday on the Personal Consumption Expenditures price index, the metric it uses to set its 2% inflation target. As of February annualized PCE inflation was 5%.An updated Employment Cost Index will also be released that day, providing a broader view of employer labor costs. The ECI is only released quarterly and includes both worker pay and benefits like healthcare, giving what Fed officials regard as a clearer sense of employment-related cost trends.Carrying perhaps even more weight at the upcoming meeting will be the results of the latest Senior Loan Officer Opinion Survey, a questionnaire sent to a sample of U.S. banks every three months with the results presented at every other Fed meeting.Because the SLOOS report will be released publicly about a week after the Fed convenes, markets and investors will have no way to process it in advance, unlike most other economic data relevant to the central bank's decision-making.Though it is qualitative information, the SLOOS questions about whether banks are tightening or loosening loan standards are seen as a leading indicator of lending trends.For Fed officials, it could influence their view of whether the economy and inflation are likely to slow more - perhaps much more - quickly than anticipated. That in turn could shape views about whether interest rates can be held steady after the next rate increase or need to rise further, and how that outlook is characterized in a Fed policy statement that currently says "some additional policy firming" will likely be needed.In the last SLOOS survey, presented at the Fed's Jan. 31-Feb. 1 meeting and released publicly about a week later, loan officers reported that conditions were tightening, though Fed staff noted in their presentation of the results that some key types of credit to businesses and households continued to grow.Reuters GraphicsEconomists expect the upcoming survey will show conditions tightening further still, this time alongside data showing credit from banks in decline.For the Fed the challenge will be deciphering if that is all just the expected impact of a record-setting year of rate hikes finally being felt in the economy, or something that goes beyond what's needed to control inflation.While a broad banking crisis may have been avoided, the focus is now on "the severity of the tightening of lending standards" seen in the SLOOS, Oxford Economics Chief U.S. Economist Ryan Sweet wrote recently.The last survey already points to a drop in business investment later this year, and "the risks continue to be weighted towards a larger hit to gross domestic product," he said. "Banks may not be done tightening lending standards, which will restrict access to credit, hurt business investment, reduce business formation, and weigh on job growth and consumer spending."Reporting by Howard Schneider; Editing by Andrea RicciOur Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles.Howard SchneiderThomson ReutersCovers the U.S. Federal Reserve, monetary policy and the economy, a graduate of the University of Maryland and Johns Hopkins University with previous experience as a foreign correspondent, economics reporter and on the local staff of the Washington Post.Read NextMacro MatterscategoryChina's on the move again, economic outlook brightens, article with imageJanuary 13, 2023Macro MatterscategoryJapan's biggest banks to raise housing loan rates after BOJ's policy tweak, article with galleryDecember 30, 2022Macro MatterscategoryJapan's tourism restart stirs hope of service-sector recovery -PMI, article with imageOctober 5, 2022Macro MatterscategorySouth Korea's Sept inflation slows but tightening bias seen intact, article with imageOctober 5, 2022MarketsRunaway leaders Napoli close on title with last-gasp win at Juve, article with gallerySportscategory · April 23, 2023 · 9:50 PM UTC · undefined agoA stoppage-time goal by forward Giacomo Raspadori earned runaway leaders Napoli a 1-0 win at Juventus on Sunday that leaves them on the brink of claiming their first Serie A title since 1990 after the hosts had two goals ruled out following VAR reviews.Asian MarketscategoryMorning Bid: Japan opens new chapter, maybe era, article with image9:49 PM UTC .

US Fed likely to make final interest rate hike in May, and other economy stories you need to read this week

Gabi Thesing
Senior Writer, Forum Agenda

















































This weekly round-up brings you the latest stories from the world of economics and finance.
Top economy stories: US Fed could make final interest rate hike of 2023 in May; China's economy gathers speed but global risks raise challenges to outlook; Britain is only large developed nation with double-digit inflation.



    1. US Fed likely to deliver 25-basis-point interest rate hike then pause for rest of year

The US Federal Reserve will deliver a final 25-basis-point interest rate increase in May and then hold rates steady for the rest of 2023, according to a Reuters poll of economists. The poll also showed that a short and shallow US recession is likely this year.






                The Fed appears to be coming close to the end of its rate hiking cycle.

Worries about an economic downturn, which the Fed also highlighted at its 21-22 March policy meeting, and concerns about banking sector stress have encouraged markets to price in at least a 25-basis-point cut by the end of 2023.


But a rate cut looks less likely than higher rates in the face of inflation that is running well over twice the Fed's 2% target, ongoing strength in the labour market and a significant easing in banking sector stress over the past few weeks.


US two-year Treasury yields, which typically reflect near-term interest rate expectations, have soared nearly 75 basis points in the past month as still-strong data have reduced the prospect of rate cuts.


"On the data front, despite the slowdown in inflation in March, there is still a lot more work to be done to get back to the 2% target," said Michael Gapen, chief US economist at BofA Securities. 


    2. China's economy gathers speed but global risks raise challenges to outlook 

China's economy grew at a faster-than-expected pace in the first quarter as the end of strict COVID curbs lifted businesses and consumers out of crippling pandemic disruptions, although headwinds from a global slowdown point to a bumpy ride ahead.


More than a year-long sweeping streak of global monetary policy tightening to rein in inflation has dented world economic growth, leaving many countries including China reliant on domestic demand to spur momentum and raising the challenge for policymakers looking for post-COVID stability.






                China's economy grew faster than forecast in the first quarter.
              

                Image: Reuters Graphics 
              




China's GDP grew 4.5% year-on-year in January-March, data from the National Bureau of Statistics showed. This is up from 2.9% in the previous quarter. It also beat analyst forecasts for a 4.0% expansion and marked the strongest growth in a year. 


A Chinese economic rebound is still seen as key to global growth this year as developed nations are hobbled by persistently high inflation, rising interest rates and sluggish expansion post-pandemic, and Russia’s invasion of Ukraine.


    3. News in brief: Stories on the economy from around the world

Britain is now the only large developed nation with double-digit inflation rates. Its annual consumer price inflation fell to 10.1% last month but defied forecasts for a bigger drop from February's 10.4% after a record rise in bread prices, the Office for National Statistics said.


The German government is set to slightly raise its economic growth forecast for this year to 0.4% from its previously predicted 0.2%, two sources told Reuters. For 2024, the government will slightly lower its prediction, to 1.6% from the 1.8% foreseen in January, the sources said.

The Bank of Japan's new chief Kazuo Ueda will not start unwinding its ultra-easy policy at the bank's 27-28 April meeting, nearly 90% of economists polled by Reuters said. The chance of a surprise tweak at Ueda's first rate-review appears to have subsided after he said changes won't happen quickly because of Western banking turmoil and fears of a global economic slowdown.

Argentina's central bank hiked the benchmark interest rate by a sharper-than-expected 300 basis points to 81% after inflation soared past expectations in March to hit 104% on an annual basis. March inflation data clocked in at 7.7%, the highest monthly level in two decades.


Australia's central bank is expected to get a new specialist board to manage monetary policy. It will give independent expert members more responsibility for setting interest rates, marking a dilution of the bank's traditional power over policy.


Russia's economic growth for 2023 is likely to come in at the top end of the central bank's forecast range of between minus 1% and 1%, deputy central bank governor Alexei Zabotkin said in an interview on state TV. Russia's economy shrank 2.1% in 2022 under the pressure of Western sanctions and fallout from its military campaign in Ukraine. 


Governments and central banks need to embrace the need for deeper reform, rather than employing quick-fix monetary and fiscal measures any time a recession hits, Bank for International Settlements Chief Agustín Carstens has warned. These measures just stoke inflation or breed financial instability, The Financial Times reported him as saying.


    4. More on finance and the economy on Agenda

While interest rates in advanced economies have begun to rise, rampant inflation has diminished potential profits, experts say. In its latest report, the IMF predicts that real interest rates in advanced economies will return to their pre-pandemic levels once inflation is tamed. 


The recent collapse of Silicon Valley Bank stemmed from falling asset values as interest rates rose – this is known as interest rate risk. Central banks could come under pressure to reduce the chance of interest rate risk, which may in turn cause them to slow down rate rises – but this could mean even higher rates are needed in the longer term.


Interest rates have been rising globally because of record-breaking inflation – and it means changes to the way we spend and save money. Here's how it affects your life – the economy, your spending, your savings, housing costs and the cost of credit.
