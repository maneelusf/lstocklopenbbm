Our failure to obtain these services on acceptable terms could materially harm our business.These difficulties include: • the challenge of integrating the acquired businesses and properties while carrying on the ongoing operations of our business; • the inability to retain key employees of the acquired business; • the challenge of inconsistencies in standards, controls, procedures and policies of the acquired business; • potential unknown liabilities, unforeseen expenses or higher-than-expected integration costs; • an overall post-completion integration process that takes longer than originally anticipated; • potential lack of operating experience in a geographic market of the acquired properties; and • the possibility of faulty assumptions underlying our expectations.The proposals include: repeal of the percentage depletion allowance for oil and gas properties; elimination of the ability to fully deduct intangible drilling costs in the year incurred; and increase in the geological and geophysical amortization period for independent producers.In addition, under the SEC’ s reserves reporting rules, because PUD reserves generally may be recorded only if they relate to wells scheduled to be drilled within five years of the date of booking, we may be required to remove any PUD reserves that are no longer planned to be developed 25 Table of Contentswithin this five-year time frame.The lack of available capacity on these systems and facilities could reduce the price offered for our production or result in the shut-in of producing wells or the delay or discontinuance of development plans for properties.The possibility for these impacts may increase with respect to wells that are shut in as a response to lower commodity prices or the lack of pipeline and storage capacity.For more information about our debt agreements, please read“ Management’ s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations-Financial Condition-Liquidity and Capital Resources.”Please read“ Management’ s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” in Item 7 and“ Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk” in Item 7A for further discussion concerning our use of derivatives.Although currently no universal rating standards exist, the importance of sustainability evaluations is becoming more broadly accepted by investors and stockholders, with some using these ratings to inform investment and voting decisions.Studies have found that emission of certain gases, commonly referred to as greenhouse gases (“ GHG”), impact the earth’ s climate.Although we are not a party to any such climate-related or“ greenwashing” litigation currently, unfavorable rulings against us in any such case brought against us in the future could significantly impact our operations and could have an adverse impact on our financial condition.OVERVIEWCimarex MergerOn October 1, 2021, we and Cimarex completed the Merger.Our Board of Directors previously approved an increase in our base quarterly dividend rate in the fourth quarter of 2021 and second quarter of 2021 from $0.11 per share to $0.125 per share and from $0.10 per share to $0.11 per share, respectively.In February 2022, our Board of Directors approved an increase in our base quarterly dividend from $0.125 per share to $0.15 per share beginning in the first quarter of 2022.Unproved oil and gas properties are assessed periodically for impairment on an aggregate basis through periodic updates to our undeveloped acreage amortization based on past drilling and exploration experience, our expectation of converting leases to held by production and average property lives.We measure the non-performance 46 Table of Contentsrisk of our counterparties by reviewing credit default swap spreads for the various financial institutions with which we have derivative transactions, while our non-performance risk is evaluated using a market credit spread provided by several of our banks.The table below reflects our G & A expense for the periods identified: G & A expense, excluding stock-based compensation and merger-related expenses, increased $134 million primarily due to the Merger, which significantly expanded our headcount and office-related expenses.The increase was attributable to production from properties acquired in the Merger, partially offset by lower production in the Marcellus Shale due to the timing of drilling and completion activities.The increase was attributable to production from properties acquired in the Merger.The increase was attributable to production from properties acquired in the Merger.The increase in capital expenditures was attributable to our expanded operations after the Merger.The increase in natural gas, oil and NGL revenue was primarily due to increased production as a result of the Merger and an overall increase in commodity prices.The increase in production was primarily related to properties acquired in the Merger, which significantly expanded our operations, partially offset by lower production related to the timing of our drilling and completion activities in the Marcellus Shale.The increase in depreciation expense during 2022 as compared to 2021 is primarily due to increased depreciation on our gathering and plant facilities acquired in the Merger.
