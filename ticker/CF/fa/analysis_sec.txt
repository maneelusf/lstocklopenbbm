If natural gas prices outside of North America were to decrease or North American natural gas prices were to increase, our favorable energy cost differentials relative to the industry’ s marginal nitrogen producers could significantly erode, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.Fixing the selling prices of our products, often months in advance of their ultimate delivery to customers, typically causes our reported selling prices and margins to differ from spot market prices and margins available at the time of shipment.We believe the demand for green and blue ammonia could take several years to materialize and then ten or more years to fully develop and mature, and we cannot be certain that this market or the market for green and blue hydrogen will grow to the size or at the rate we expect or at all.For example, in 2022, we were named along with other parties in certain product liability actions relating to a product containing the herbicide paraquat, which was allegedly sold, manufactured, distributed and/or marketed by Terra Industries Inc. (Terra) before it exited such lines of business, which exit occurred more than ten years before CF Holdings acquired Terra in April 2010.During periods of industry oversupply, our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows tend to be affected negatively as the price at which we sell our products typically declines, resulting in possible reduced profit margins, write-downs in the value of our inventory and temporary or permanent curtailments of production.Any reduction in the demand for chemical fertilizer products, including as a result of technological developments and/or limitations on the use and application of chemical fertilizers, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.The major natural gas trading point for the United Kingdom is the National Balancing Point (NBP).Weather can also have an adverse effect on crop yields, which could lower the income of growers and impair their ability to purchase fertilizer from our customers.Our inability to predict future seasonal fertilizer demand accurately could result in our having excess inventory, potentially at costs in excess of market value.A change in the volume of products that our customers purchase on a forward basis, or the percentage of our sales volume that is sold to our customers on a forward basis, could increase our exposure to fluctuations in our profit margins and working capital and materially adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.Any cash payments received in advance from customers in connection with forward sales are reflected on our consolidated balance sheets as a current liability until the related orders are shipped, which can take up to several months.As a result of doing business internationally, we are exposed to a risk of violating anti-corruption laws and sanctions regulations applicable in those countries where we, our partners or our agents operate.Under the tax laws of the foreign countries in which we operate, those international earnings could be subject to withholding taxes when repatriated; therefore, the repatriation of those earnings could result in an increase in our worldwide effective tax rate and an increase in our use of cash to pay these taxes.Canada has increased its emissions reduction target under the Paris Agreement to 40-45% (up from 30%) below 2005 levels by 2030.In the event that the growth in supply of green and blue ammonia and green and blue hydrogen exceeds the growth in demand for those products, the resulting unfavorable supply and demand balance could lead to lower selling prices than we expect, which could negatively affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.For a discussion and analysis of the year ended December 31, 2021 compared to December 31, 2020, you should read Item 7.As a result, we recognized a gain of $112 million, which is reflected in cost of sales in our consolidated statement of operations for the year ended December 31, 2021.The settlement loss is reflected in other non-operating—net in our consolidated statement of operations for the year ended December 31, 2022.See Note 11—Pension and Other Postretirement Benefits for further information for the year ended December 31, 2022.38 Table of ContentsCF INDUSTRIES HOLDINGS, INC.
