the asset is not recoverable.If events or circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable, we assess its recoverability by comparing the carrying amount to our estimate of the undiscounted future cash flows, excluding interest charges, of the asset.An investment is considered impaired if we determine that its fair value is less than the net carrying value of the investment on an other-than-temporary basis.The impairment loss is reflected in Mezzanine investment income (loss), net, in our Consolidated Statements of Operations for the year ended December 31, 2022, and as a reduction in Mezzanine investment in our Consolidated Balance Sheets at December 31, 2022.
