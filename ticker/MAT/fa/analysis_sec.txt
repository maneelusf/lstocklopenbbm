To service Mattel's indebtedness, Mattel requires a significant amount of cash and Mattel's ability to generate cash depends on many factors beyond Mattel's control.If any of the risks, events, and uncertainties described in the cautionary risk factors listed below actually occurs, Mattel's business, financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected, and such effects could at times be material.Mattel's business and operating results depend largely upon the appeal of its products, driven by both innovation and marketing.Mattel's failure to successfully meet the challenges outlined above in a timely and cost-effective manner could decrease demand for its products and entertainment offerings and may adversely affect Mattel's business, financial condition, and results of operations.In addition, any significant failure, inadequacy, or interruption from such vendors or outsourcers could harm Mattel's ability to effectively operate its business.Any shortcoming of a Mattel vendor or outsourcer, particularly an issue related to compliance or reputation, or affecting the quality of these services or systems, risks damage to Mattel's reputation and brand value, and potentially adverse effects to Mattel's business, financial condition, and results of operations.Disruptions, and government responses to any disruption, could adversely affect Mattel's business, financial position, sales, and results of operations and may vary based on the length and severity of the disruption.Financial and AccountingTo the extent Mattel is unable to realize the anticipated cost savings from its previously announced cost savings programs or incurs additional and/or unexpected costs to realize such cost savings, Mattel's business, financial condition, and results of operations could be adversely affected.Litigation, government investigations, or regulatory enforcement actions arising out of any such failure or alleged failure could subject Mattel to civil and criminal penalties that could materially and adversely affect Mattel's reputation, financial condition, and operating results.20 Legal and RegulatoryMattel relies extensively on information technology in its operations, and any material failure, inadequacy, interruption, or security breach of that technology could have an adverse effect on its business, financial condition, and results of operations.If Mattel fails to comply with applicable U. S. and foreign laws related to privacy, data security, and data protection, it could adversely affect Mattel's operating results and financial condition.Responding to any infringement claim, regardless of its validity, may be costly and time-consuming and may divert management and key personnel from business operations.Mattel's failure to protect its proprietary intellectual property and information, including with respect to any successful challenge to Mattel's ownership of its intellectual property or significant infringements of its intellectual property, could have an adverse effect on Mattel's business, financial condition, and results of operations.These issues and activities can divert development and management resources, adversely affect Mattel's business operations, decrease sales, increase legal fees and other costs, and put Mattel at a competitive disadvantage compared to other manufacturers not affected by similar issues with products, any of which could have an adverse effect on Mattel's business, financial condition, and results of operations.These factors resulted in strong growth in net sales during the nine months ended September 30, 2022.Dolls gross billings decreased 9%, of which 8% was due to lower billings of Barbie products, 2% was due to lower billings of American Girl products, and 2% was due to lower billings of Spirit products.Dolls gross billings decreased 7%, of which 13% was due to lower billings of Barbie products, partially offset by higher billings of Monster High products of 5%.Dolls gross billings decreased 10%, of which 6% was due to lower billings of Barbie products, 2% was due to lower billings of Spirit products and 2% was due to lower billings of Enchantimals products.American Girl SegmentThe following table provides a summary of Mattel's net sales and segment operating income for the American Girl segment for 2022 and 2021: N/M-Not meaningfulNet sales for the American Girl segment in 2022 were $226.9 million, a decrease of $43.4 million or 16%, as compared to $270.3 million in 2021.The decrease in gross billings was due to lower billings of Dolls and Infant, Toddler, and Preschool, partially offset by higher billings of Vehicles and Action Figures, Building Sets, Games, and Other.The decrease in interest expense was primarily due to a loss on extinguishment of debt of $101.7 million as a result of the redemption of the 6.75% 2017/2018 Senior Notes due December 2025 (the "2025 Notes") in 2021 and lower interest expense of $19.3 million in 2022 due to the refinancing and repayment of the 2025 Notes in 2021.The decrease was primarily due to lower billings of 2022 Girl of the Year dolls of $14.5 million and lower billings of historical character dolls products of $13.3 million.At December 31, 2022, Mattel had no outstanding borrowings under the Revolving Credit Facility and approximately $8 million in outstanding letters of credit under the Revolving Credit Facility.This was partially offset by lower billings of other Action Figures products of 7%, and lower billings of Games products of 5%.The decrease in gross margin was primarily due to cost inflation of 380 basis points, inventory management efforts of 110 basis points, including higher close-out sales and inventory obsolescence, and higher royalty expense and other of 60 basis points.This was partially offset by lower billings of other Action Figures products of 7% and lower billings of Plush products of 6%.This was partially offset by lower billings of other Action Figures products of 7% and lower billings of Games products of 7%.The decline was due to changes in the mix of sales as there were lower sales in markets with higher average sales adjustment rates.Inventory obsolescence expense is charged to cost of sales and establishes a lower cost basis for the inventory.In anticipation of retail sales in the traditional holiday season, Mattel significantly increases its production in advance of the peak selling period, resulting in a corresponding build-up of inventory levels in the first three quarters of its fiscal year.
