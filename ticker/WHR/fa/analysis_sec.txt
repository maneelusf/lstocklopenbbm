S. and abroad, including uncertainty regarding impacts to our current global tax positions and future tax planning; • Operational risk, including but not limited to data privacy and cybersecurity incidents, as a result of salaried workforce extended remote work arrangements, and operational delays as a result of salaried employee furlough and collective vacation actions in certain countries, and restrictions on employee travel; • Operational disruption if key employees terminate their employment or become ill, as well as diversion of our management team's attention from non-COVID-19 related matters; • Potential investigations, legal claims or litigation against us for actions we have taken or may take, or decisions we have made or may make, as a consequence of the pandemic; and • Potential delays in resolving pending legal matters as a result of court, administrative and other closures and delays in many of our regions.In addition, adverse publicity about regulatory or legal action against us, product safety, data privacy breaches or quality issues, or negative association with any one brand could damage our reputation and brand image, undermine our customers'confidence in us and reduce long-term demand for our products, even if the regulatory or legal action is unfounded or not material to our operations.While our evaluation of any potential transaction includes business, legal and financial due diligence with the goal of identifying and evaluating the material risks involved, our due diligence reviews may not identify all of the issues necessary to accurately estimate the cost and potential loss contingencies of a particular transaction, including potential exposure to regulatory sanctions resulting from an acquisition target's previous activities or costs associated with any quality issues with an acquisition target's legacy products.On November 30, 2020, IBA announced that, following a consultation period, it intends to announce that for USD LIBOR, it intends to cease publication of 1-week and 2-month LIBOR at the end of 2021 and that it does not intend to cease publication of other tenors of USD LIBOR until June 30, 2023.For example, the effect of the UK's exit from the European Union (“ Brexit”), despite their December 2020 trade agreement, remains uncertain and could adversely impact certain areas of our business, including, but not limited to, an increase in duties and delays in the delivery of products, and adverse impacts to our suppliers and financing institutions.STRATEGIC RISKSWe face intense competition in the major home appliance industry and failure to successfully compete could negatively affect our business and financial performance.The highly competitive nature of our industry requires that we effectively execute and manage our business objectives including our global operating platform initiative.We depend upon the continued services and performance of our key executives, senior management and skilled personnel, particularly professionals with experience in our business and operations and the home appliance industry.The Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 (ERISA) and the Internal Revenue Code, as amended, govern the funding obligations for our U.
