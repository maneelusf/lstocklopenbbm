We are subject to various risks arising from our international business operations and relationships—We are subject to both the risks of conducting international business and the requirements of the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act of 1977 (the FCPA) associated with our aggregates production facilities including those located in British Columbia, Canada; Puerto Cortés, Honduras; and Quintana Roo, Mexico.Our effective tax rate is subject to change—Factors that may increase our future effective tax rate include, but are not limited to: governmental authorities increasing statutory income tax rates or eliminating deductions or credits; the mix of jurisdictions in which our earnings are taxed; changes in the valuation of our deferred tax assets and liabilities; the effect our stock price has with regard to excess tax benefits from share-based compensation; adjustments to estimated taxes upon finalization of various income tax returns; the resolution of issues arising from income tax audits with various tax authorities; and the interpretation of income tax laws and/or administrative practices.These estimates and assumptions could change significantly in the future and could adversely affect our financial position, results of operations or cash flows.These state and federal highway programs, as well as funding for other aggregates-intensive public infrastructure, will support demand for our products for several years to come.This significant competition could lead to lower prices and lower sales volumes.The loss of use of information technology systems (whether ours or our service providers), regardless of the cause, would disrupt our business operations.In November 2021, the federal Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act (IIJA), which included a five year road, bridge and public transportation program reauthorization at record levels, was signed into law.While our industry was deemed essential in every state in which we operate and we continued to operate across our footprint when such measures were in place, our operations, supply chain, customers, and transportation networks were negatively impacted by such measures (including our own) and the health of our employees.In 2022, voters in local jurisdictions in California, Florida, Georgia, North Carolina, South Carolina, Texas and Virginia, among others, approved bond and revenue-raising measures to provide additional resources for transportation projects.However, given the time to set up new federal programs, varying state and local budgetary situations and the stages of projects, we cannot be entirely assured of the existence, amount and timing of appropriations for future public infrastructure projects.We continue to vigorously pursue all lawful avenues available to us in order to protect our rights, under both Mexican and international law and intend to resume normal operations in Mexico as soon as permitted.Our long-term success depends upon securing and permitting aggregates reserves in strategically located areas—Construction aggregates have a high weight-to-price ratio, and transportation costs can quickly exceed the cost of the aggregates.Our future growth depends in part on acquiring and successfully integrating other businesses in our industry—Our ability to acquire and integrate businesses is dependent upon the availability of attractive businesses with owners that are willing to sell at fair market prices, conducting proper due diligence on such available businesses, and developing and executing integration plans for acquired businesses.FINANCIAL/ACCOUNTING RISKSOur industry is capital intensive, resulting in significant fixed and semi-fixed costs—Due to the high levels of fixed capital required for extracting and producing construction aggregates, our earnings are highly sensitive to changes in product shipments.The failure to keep secure the confidential and sensitive data about our business, employees, suppliers and customers, regardless of the reason for such failure, could expose us, our employees, suppliers and/or our customers to the misuse of such data and could result in reputational harm and financial liability.During the third quarter of 2022, we recognized a long-lived asset impairment loss of $16.9 million for assets classified as held for sale (subsequently sold during the fourth quarter).We are required to account for the effects of changes in income tax rates on deferred tax balances in the period in which the legislation is enacted.See the definitions and reconciliations within this Item 7 under the caption“ Reconciliation of Non-GAAP Financial Measures.”It’ s the right thing to do for society, for our business and our stakeholders.Effective management throughout the life cycle of our land—from pre-mining utilization as agriculture and timber development, to post-mining development as water reservoirs or residential and commercial development—not only generates significant additional value for our shareholders but greatly benefits the communities in which we operate.Shipments were negatively impacted by the absence of tons available from our Mexico operations which were unexpectedly and arbitrarily shut down by the Mexican government in May of 2022 (for additional information, see Note 12“ Commitments and Contingencies” in Item 8“ Financial Statements and Supplementary Data”).During 2021, we incurred $12.1 million of non-cash pension settlement charges—this partial settlement will benefit future expense and funding requirements (see Note 10“ Benefit Plans” in Item 8“ Financial Statements and Supplementary Data”).In addition, 2022 includes a $15.3 million charge for a litigation matter (see Note 12“ Commitments and Contingencies” in Item 8“ Financial Statements and Supplementary Data”).Although ROIC is a standard financial metric, numerous methods exist for calculating a company’ s ROIC.CASHIncluded in our December 31, 2022 cash and cash equivalents and restricted cash balances of $161.5 million is $0.1 million of restricted cash (see Note 1“ Summary of Significant Accounting Policies” in Item 8“ Financial Statements and Supplementary Data” under the caption Restricted Cash).Further, proceeds from the sale of property, plant & equipment and businesses were down $127.8 million in 2022 from 2021, primarily reflecting the 2021 sale of reclaimed real estate in Southern California (see Note 19“ Acquisitions and Divestitures” in Item 8“ Financial Statements and Supplementary Data”).As of December 31, 2022, maturities for the next four quarters and for the next five years are as follows (excluding any borrowings on the line of credit): For additional information regarding debt payments and maturities, see Note 6“ Debt” in Item 8“ Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.”STANDBY LETTERS OF CREDITFor a discussion of our standby letters of credit, see Note 6“ Debt” in Item 8“ Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.”See Note 10“ Benefit Plans” in Item 8“ Financial Statements and Supplementary Data” for the discount rates used for PBO, service cost, and interest cost calculations; the expected return on plan assets; and the rate of increase in the per capita cost of healthcare benefits.For additional information about claims and litigation including self-insurance, see Note 1“ Summary of Significant Accounting Policies” in Item 8“ Financial Statements and Supplementary Data” under the caption Claims and Litigation Including Self-insurance.NEW ACCOUNTING STANDARDSFor a discussion of
