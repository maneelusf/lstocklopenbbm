20 The occurrence of any of the above factors, individually or in combination, could prevent us from being able to obtain the external capital we require on terms that are acceptable to us, or at all, which could have a material adverse effect on (i) our ability to finance our future growth and acquire hotels, (ii) our ability to meet our anticipated requirements for working capital, debt service and capital expenditures, and (iii) our results of operations and financial condition.Our indebtedness requires us to commit a significant portion of our annual cash flow from operations to debt service payments, which reduces the availability of our cash flow to fund working capital, capital expenditures, expansion efforts, dividends and distributions and other general corporate needs.We rely on Marriott’ s personnel, expertise, technical resources and information systems, proprietary information, good faith and judgment to manage and maintain our hotel operations efficiently, effectively, profitably and in compliance with the terms, responsibilities and duties of our management agreements and all applicable laws and regulations.However, we remain subject to many of the costs and risks generally associated with the hotel labor force, particularly at those hotels with unionized labor.Our third-party hotel managers are dependent on information technology networks and systems, including the internet, to access, process, transmit and store proprietary and customer information.These systems require the collection and retention of large volumes of personally identifiable information of hotel guests, including credit card numbers and passport numbers.Our hotel managers may store and process such proprietary and customer information both on systems located at the hotels that we own and other hotels that they operate and manage, their corporate locations and at third-party owned facilities, including, for example, in a third-party hosted cloud environment.These threats can be introduced in any number of ways, including through third parties accessing our hotel managers’ information networks and systems or by exploiting vulnerabilities in third-party software, technologies, tools, services or systems.In addition to the information technologies and systems of our managers used to operate our hotels, we have our own corporate technologies and systems that are used to access, store, transmit, and manage or support a variety of our business processes and information.Our hotels are subject to various other forms of regulation, including Title III of the Americans with Disabilities Act (“ ADA”), building codes and regulations pertaining to fire and life safety.Under the ADA, all public accommodations are required to meet certain federal rules related to access and use by disabled persons and we incur capital expenditures to make our hotels accessible.Depreciation and amortization expense decreased $98 million, or 12.9%, to $664 million in 2022, due primarily to impairment expense of $92 million in 2021 that did not occur in 2022.F & B expenses increased $423 million, or 83.8%, in 2022.Total management fees increased $120 million, or 123.7%, in 2022.Base management fees, which generally are calculated as a percentage of total revenues, increased $56 million, or 66.7%, compared to 2021.We expect the final two hotels, Marriott Marquis San Diego Marina and Washington Marriott at Metro Center, to be completed in the first half of 2023.As a result of legislation enacted by the CARES Act in 2020, a portion of the 2020 domestic net operating loss was carried back to 2017-2019 in order to procure a refund of U. S. federal corporate income taxes previously paid.For example, in 2017, as a result of the reduction of the U. S. federal corporate income tax rate from 35% to 21% by the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, we remeasured our domestic deferred tax assets as of December 31, 2017 and recorded a one-time adjustment to reduce our deferred tax assets and increase the provision for income taxes by approximately $11 million.All Owned Hotel RevPAR increased 63.2%, compared to 2021, due to a 19.1 percentage point increase in occupancy and a 15.8% increase in average room rate.Blue Chip Economic Indicators consensus currently estimates an increase in real U. S. GDP of 0.5% for 2023, with slight declines in the first and second quarter, while business investment is anticipated to increase just 0.7%.Equity in earnings of affiliates decreased $28 million, or 90.3%, in 2022 as compared to 2021, primarily due to unrealized losses recorded by Fifth Wall Ventures, L. P. in 2022 compared to unrealized gains in 2021, partially offset by improved operations at our non-consolidated properties.Certain covenants are less restrictive at any time that our leverage ratio is below 6.0 x.
