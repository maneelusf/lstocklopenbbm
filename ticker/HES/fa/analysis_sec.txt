Other factors include, but are not limited to: worldwide and domestic supplies of and demand for crude oil, NGL and natural gas; political conditions and events (including weather, instability, changes in governments, armed conflict, economic sanctions and outbreaks of infectious diseases, such as COVID-19) around the world and in particular in crude oil or natural gas producing regions; the cost of exploring for, developing and producing crude oil, NGL and natural gas; the price, availability of and demand for alternative fuels or other forms of energy; the effect of energy conservation and environmental protection efforts; and overall economic conditions globally (including inflation, slower growth or recession, higher interest rates, supply chain constraints, and consequences associated with the ongoing invasion of Ukraine by Russia).See Note 8, Asset Retirement Obligations in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.A decrease in energy use due to weather changes may affect our financial condition through decreased revenues.Additionally, governmental actions could include post-production deductions from royalty payments; limitations or prohibitions on the sales of new oil and gas leases or extensions on existing oil and gas leases; adverse court decisions with respect to the sale of new and existing oil and gas leases; expropriation or nationalization of property; mandatory government participation, cancellation or amendment of contract rights; imposition of capital controls or blocking of funds; changes in import and export regulations; the imposition of tariffs; and anti-bribery or anti-corruption laws.In recent years, proposals for limitations on access to oil and gas exploration and development opportunities and related litigation have grown in certain areas and may include efforts to reduce access to public and private lands; restriction of exploration and production activities within government-owned and other lands; delaying or canceling permits for drilling or pipeline construction; restrictions or changes to existing pipeline easements; limiting or banning industry techniques such as hydraulic fracturing and/or adding restrictions on the use of water and associated disposal; imposition of set-backs on oil and gas sites; reduction of sulfur content in bunker fuel; delaying or denying air-quality or siting permits; advocating for increased regulations, punitive taxation, or citizen ballot initiatives or moratoriums on industry activity; and the use of social media channels to cause reputational harm.We do not always control decisions made under joint operating agreements and the parties under such agreements may fail to meet their obligations.For example, the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 (“ IRA”) includes a methane emissions reduction program for petroleum and natural gas systems, which requires the EPA to impose a“ waste emissions charge” on excess methane emissions from certain natural gas and oil sources that are required to report under EPA’ s Greenhouse Gas Reporting Program beginning January 1, 2024 and also provides significant funding and incentives for research and development of competing low carbon energy production methods.Moreover, these increased duties may lead to an increase in compliance costs.Although currently we do not have any borrowings under our long-term credit facility, a ratings downgrade, rising interest rates, continued weakness in the oil and gas industry or negative outcomes within commodity and financial markets could adversely impact our access to capital markets by increasing the costs of financing, or by impacting our ability to obtain financing on satisfactory terms.Our control of Hess Midstream LP bestows upon us additional duties and obligations including, but not limited to, the obligations associated with managing potential conflicts of interests and additional reporting requirements from the Securities and Exchange Commission.In 2022, there was no significant hurricane-related downtime whereas in 2021, hurricane-related downtime reduced net production by 4,000 boepd and hurricane related maintenance and repair costs were approximately $7 million.We recognize that climate change and sustainability is a growing global environmental concern.Furthermore, the threat of terrorism around the world also poses additional risks to our operations and the operations of the oil and gas industry in general.• Crude oil inventories write-down: We incurred a pre-tax charge of $53 million ($52 million after income taxes) to adjust crude oil inventories to their net realizable value at the end of the first quarter following the significant decline in crude oil prices.We currently plan to have six FPSOs with an aggregate expected production capacity of more than 1.2 million gross bopd on the Stabroek Block in 2027, and the potential for up to ten FPSOs to develop the current discovered recoverable resource base.Climate Change, Energy Transition and Our StrategyWe believe climate risks can and should be addressed while at the same time meeting the growing demand for affordable and secure energy, which is essential to ensure a just and orderly energy transition that aligns with the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals.Under all of the IEA scenarios, oil and natural gas are expected to be needed for decades to come and we expect that significant investment will be required to meet the world’ s projected growing energy needs, both in renewable energy sources and in oil and gas.Proceeds from asset sales were $178 million in 2022 (2021: $427 million).Borrowings on the new facility will generally bear interest at 1.400% above SOFR, though the interest rate is subject to adjustment based on the credit rating of the Corporation's senior, unsecured, non-credit enhanced long-term debt.The revolving credit facility is subject to customary representations, warranties, customary events of default and covenants, including a financial covenant limiting the ratio of Total Consolidated Debt to Total Capitalization of the Corporation and its consolidated subsidiaries to 65%, and a financial covenant limiting the ratio of secured debt to Consolidated Net Tangible Assets of the Corporation and its consolidated subsidiaries to 15% (as these capitalized terms are defined in the credit agreement for the revolving credit facility).The indentures for the Corporation's fixed-rate senior unsecured notes limit the ratio of secured debt to Consolidated Net Tangible Assets (as that term is defined in the indentures) to 15%.The most restrictive of the financial covenants relating to our fixed-rate senior unsecured notes and our revolving credit facility would allow us to borrow up to an additional $2,146 million of secured debt at December 31, 2022.Pricing levels for the facility fee and interest-rate margins are based on HESM Opco’ s ratio of total debt to EBITDA (as defined in the credit facilities).If HESM Opco obtains an investment grade credit rating, the pricing levels will be based on HESM Opco’ s credit ratings in effect from time to time.We have concluded that we are the primary beneficiary of the VIE, as defined in the accounting standards, since we have the power through Hess Corporation’ s approximate 41% consolidated ownership interest in Hess Midstream LP to direct those activities that most significantly impact the economic performance of Hess Midstream LP, and are obligated to absorb losses or have the right to receive benefits that could potentially be significant to Hess Midstream LP.Environment, Health and SafetyOur long-term vision and values provide a foundation for how we do business and define our commitment to meeting high standards of corporate citizenship and creating a long lasting positive impact on the communities where we do business.At the international level, the Paris Agreement on climate change aimed to enhance global response to global temperature changes and to reduce GHG emissions, among other things.
