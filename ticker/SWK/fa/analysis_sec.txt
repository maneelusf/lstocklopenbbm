Subsequent to the filing of its 2020 Form 10-K, the Company received comments from the SEC Staff regarding its accounting for equity units issued in May 2017 and November 2019 (the“ Equity Units”).Risks associated with business combinations and investment transactions include the following, any of which could adversely affect the Company's financial results, including its effective tax rate: • the failure to identify the most suitable candidates for acquisitions and to close on such acquisitions within desired time frames and at a reasonable cost; • difficulty in finding buyers or alternative exit strategies on acceptable terms in a timely manner, or disposing of a business at a price or on terms that are less desirable than the Company had anticipated; • the ability to conduct and evaluate the results of due diligence with respect to business combinations and investment transactions; • the failure to identify significant issues with a target company’ s product quality, financial disclosures, accounting practices or internal control deficiencies or the factors necessary to estimate reasonably accurate costs, timing and other matters, and the failure to identify, or accurately assess the risks of, historical practices of target companies that would create liability or other exposures for the Company if they continue post-completion or as a result of successor liability; • the difficulties and cost in obtaining any necessary regulatory or government approvals on acceptable terms and any delay from the inability to satisfy pre-closing conditions; • the anticipated additional revenues from the acquired companies do not materialize, despite extensive due diligence; • the acquired businesses may lose market acceptance or profitability; • the impact of divestitures on the Company's revenue growth may be larger than projected, as the Company may experience greater dis-synergies than expected; • the diversion of Company management’ s attention and other resources; • incurring significant restructuring charges and amortization expense, assuming liabilities, ongoing or new lawsuits related to the transaction or otherwise or pre-closing regulatory violations of the acquired business, potential impairment of acquired goodwill and other intangible assets, and increasing the Company's expenses and working capital requirements; • continued financial involvement in a divested business, such as through continuing equity ownership, guarantees, indemnities or other financial obligations; and • the loss of key personnel, distributors, clients or customers of acquired companies.As consumer and DIY demand softened in the second quarter of 2022, the Company’ s inventory levels peaked in the first half of the year.The Company is actively addressing this dynamic through the Global Cost Reduction Program implemented in the third quarter of 2022, which includes an initiative to reduce inventory levels by curtailing production and by reducing complexity through SKU rationalization.The minimum interest coverage ratio will revert back to 3.5 times for periods after the second quarter of 2024.The OECD Global Minimum Tax is expected to require multi-national corporations with revenue in excess of €750 million to pay an effective tax rate of at least 15% in each jurisdiction in which they operate effective with the 2024 tax year.During the first quarter of fiscal 2022, the Company successfully completed the testing necessary to conclude that the material weaknesses have been remediated.The Company generates a significant portion of its total revenue outside of the United States.The loss or material reduction of business, the lack of success of sales initiatives, or changes in customer preferences or loyalties for the Company’ s products, related to any such significant customer could have a material adverse impact on the Company’ s results of operations and cash flows.The Company’ s products are manufactured using both ferrous and non-ferrous metals including, but not limited to, steel, zinc, copper, brass, aluminum, and nickel.In February 2023, the Company entered into amendments to its credit facilities described above to: (a) amend the definition of Adjusted EBITDA to allow for additional adjustment addbacks, not to exceed $500 million in the aggregate, for amounts incurred during each four fiscal quarter period beginning with the period ending in the third quarter of 2023 through the period ending in the second quarter of 2024, and (b) amend the minimum interest coverage ratio to not less than 1.5 to 1.0 times computed quarterly, on a rolling twelve months (last twelve months) basis, for the period from and including the third quarter of 2023 through the second quarter of 2024.Although management believes the recorded tax estimates are reasonable, the ultimate outcome of any audit (or related litigation) could differ materially from amounts reflected in the Company’ s income tax accruals.The Company’ s failure to continue to successfully avoid, manage, defend, litigate and accrue for claims and litigation could negatively impact its results of operations or cash flows.The Company previously acquired a 20 percent interest in MTD in January 2019.Proceeds from the sale of these businesses were used to repay borrowings made in the first quarter of 2022 to fund the Company's share repurchase program previously discussed.Industrial net sales increased 2% compared to 2021 primarily due to a 1% increase in volume and an 8% increase in price, partially offset by a 5% decrease from foreign currency and a 2% decrease from the Oil & Gas divestiture.Industrial net sales increased 5% compared to 2020 primarily due to a 2% increase in volume, a 1% increase in price, and 1% increases from both acquisitions and foreign currency.The band reflects the wider range of 2023 demand possibilities and destocking scenarios with an earnings per share loss expected in the first half of 2023 as the Company prioritizes free cash flow generation.Management estimates the foreign currency impact from its derivative financial instruments outstanding at the end of 2022 would have been an incremental pre-tax loss of approximately $32 million based on a hypothetical 10% adverse movement in all net derivative currency positions.With respect to the quantitative tests, the key assumptions applied to the cash flow projections were discount rates, which ranged from 9.5% to 10.0%, near-term revenue growth rates over the next six years, which represented cumulative annual growth rates ranging from approximately 5% to 6%, and perpetual growth rates of 3%.The 2022 increase was primarily driven by higher U. S. interest rates and higher average balances relating to the Company's commercial paper borrowings, as well as the $1.0 billion issuance of debt in the first quarter of 2022, partially offset by higher interest income due to an increase in rates.The Syndicated 364-Day Credit Agreement serves as part of the liquidity back-stop for the Company’ s $3.5 billion U. S. Dollar and Euro commercial paper program.In September 2022, the Company terminated its second 364-Day $1.0 billion committed credit facility (the "Second 364-Day Credit Agreement"), dated November 2021, and replaced it with a $0.5 billion revolving credit loan (the "Club 364-Day Credit Agreement").The increase in 2022 was primarily due to higher intangible asset amortization due to the MTD and Excel acquisitions and appreciation of investments in 2021.
