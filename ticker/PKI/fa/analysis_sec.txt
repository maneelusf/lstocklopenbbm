As of October 3, 2021, our total assets included $11.6 billion of net intangible assets.In addition, rights granted under the license could be lost for reasons out of our control.To remain competitive, we must develop new products and periodically enhance our existing products.The loss of the services of key personnel could have a material adverse effect on our operating results.The inability to successfully transition key management roles could have a material adverse effect on our operating results.The United Kingdom's withdrawal from the European Union could adversely impact our results of operations.We have a substantial amount of debt and other financial obligations.We anticipate that we may also have to adjust the prices of many of our products to stay competitive.Our success also depends on our ability to execute leadership succession plans.We are also required to meet specified financial ratios under the terms of certain of our existing debt instruments.We ship a significant portion of our products to our customers through independent package delivery and import/export companies, including UPS and Federal Express in the United States; TNT, UPS and DHL in Europe; and UPS in Asia.A failure to do so could result in the imposition of civil, criminal or monetary penalties having a material adverse effect on our operations.Our debt level and related debt service obligations could have negative consequences, including: • requiring us to dedicate significant cash flow from operations to the payment of principal and interest on our debt, which reduces the funds we have available for other purposes, such as acquisitions and stock repurchases; • reducing our flexibility in planning for or reacting to changes in our business and market conditions; • exposing us to interest rate risk as a portion of our debt obligations are at variable rates; • increasing our foreign currency risk as a portion of our debt obligations are in denominations other than the US dollar; and • increasing the chances of a downgrade of our debt ratings due to the amount or intended purpose of our debt obligations.Our senior unsecured revolving credit facility, unsecured term loan credit facility, senior unsecured notes due in 2023 ("2023 Notes"), senior unsecured notes due in 2024 ("2024 Notes"), senior unsecured notes due in 2026 ("2026 Notes"), senior unsecured notes due in 2028 ("2028 Notes"), senior unsecured notes due in 2029 ("2029 Notes"), senior unsecured notes due in 2031 ("March 2031 Notes"), senior unsecured notes due in 2031 ("September 2031 Notes") and senior unsecured notes due in 2051 ("2051 Notes") include restrictive covenants that limit our ability to engage in activities that could otherwise benefit our company.We have included important factors below under the heading“ Risk Factors” in Part II, Item 1A. that we believe could cause actual results to differ materially from the forward-looking statements we make.
