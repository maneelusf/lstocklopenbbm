Specifically, during the first nine months of fiscal 2023, approximately 63% of our net sales came from products that were produced at outside wafer foundries compared to 60% of our net sales in fiscal 2022.During the first nine months of fiscal 2023, approximately 77% of our net sales were made to foreign customers, including 22% in China and 15% in Taiwan.During fiscal 2022, approximately 78% of our net sales were made to foreign customers, including 22% in China and 15% in Taiwan.Historically, average selling prices in the semiconductor industry decrease over the life of a product.As 42 Table of Contentsis typical in the industry, we have from time to time experienced lower than anticipated manufacturing yields.Sales to distributors accounted for approximately 47% of our net sales in the first nine months of fiscal 2023 and approximately 48% of our net sales in fiscal 2022.We recognized $1.4 million of intangible asset impairment charges in the first nine months of fiscal 2023.Failure to adequately protect our intellectual property could result in lost revenue or market opportunities.To fund our acquisition of Microsemi, we used a significant portion of our cash balances and incurred approximately $8.10 billion of additional debt.As of December 31, 2022, we had goodwill of $6.67 billion and net intangible assets of $3.54 billion.Because we operate in highly competitive environments, projections of our future operating results and cash flows may vary significantly from our actual results.At December 31, 2022, we had $253.0 million in outstanding borrowings under our Revolving Credit Facility which provides up to $2.75 billion of revolving loan commitments that terminate in 2026.At December 31, 2022, we had $5.60 billion in aggregate principal amount of Senior Notes and $766.6 million in aggregate principal of Convertible Debt outstanding.Despite supply gradually improving in recent quarters, and more improvement expected in the coming quarters, we expect that certain supply chain constraints will persist through much of calendar 2023; however, recent uncertainty in the U. S. and world economies may lessen the impact of such constraints on our business in future periods.We may increase our borrowings under our Revolving Credit Facility or seek additional equity or debt financing from time to time to maintain or expand our wafer fabrication and product assembly and test facilities, for cash dividends, for share repurchases or for acquisitions or other purposes.We may from time to time seek to refinance certain of our outstanding notes or Convertible Debt through issuances of new notes or convertible debt, tender offers, exchange transactions or open market repurchases.Such issuances, tender offers or exchanges or purchases, if any, will depend on prevailing market conditions, our ability to negotiate acceptable terms, our liquidity position and other factors.Microcontrollers and associated application development systems accounted for approximately 56.3% and 55.9% of our net sales for the three and nine months ended December 31, 2022, respectively, compared to approximately 55.3% and 55.6% of our net sales for the three and nine months ended December 31, 2021, respectively.Net sales of our microcontroller products increased 25.6% and 25.1% in the three and nine months ended December 31, 2022, respectively, compared to the three and nine months ended December 31, 2021.Our analog product line accounted for approximately 28.0% and 28.3% of our net sales for the three and nine months ended December 31, 2022, respectively, compared to approximately 28.5% and 28.6% of our net sales for the three and nine months ended December 31, 2021, respectively.Net sales from our analog product line increased 21.2% and 23.6% in the three and nine months ended December 31, 2022, respectively, compared to the three and nine months ended December 31, 2021, primarily due to strength in demand for our analog products in end markets that we serve and our price increases.Revenue from these services and products accounted for approximately 15.7% and 15.8% of our net sales for the three and nine months ended December 31, 2022, respectively, compared to approximately 16.2% and 15.8% of our net sales for the three and nine months ended December 31, 2021, respectively.Net sales related to these services and products increased 19.9% and 25.3% in the three and nine months ended December 31, 2022, respectively, compared to the three and nine months ended December 31, 2021.29 Table of ContentsDistribution Distributors accounted for approximately 48% and 47% of our net sales in the three and nine months ended December 31, 2022, respectively, and approximately 45% and 48% of our net sales in the three and nine months ended December 31, 2021, respectively.Sales to foreign customers accounted for approximately 77% of our total net sales in each of the three and nine months ended December 31, 2022 compared to approximately 78% of our total net sales in each of the three and nine months ended December 31, 2021.Approximately 59% of our assembly requirements were performed in our internal assembly facilities during each of the three and nine months ended December 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021.Approximately 68% and 67% of our test requirements 30 Table of Contentswere performed in our internal test facilities during the three and nine months ended December 31, 2022, respectively, compared to approximately 63% and 64% during the three and nine months ended December 31, 2021, respectively.Approximately 63% of our net sales came from products that were produced at outside wafer foundries during each of the three and nine months ended December 31, 2022, compared to approximately 61% and 60% during the three and nine months ended December 31, 2021, respectively.Our domestic blended statutory tax rate in each of the nine months ended December 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021 was approximately 22%.
