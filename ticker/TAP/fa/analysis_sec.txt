However, considerable judgment is required in selecting an appropriate methodology and interpreting market data to develop the estimates of fair value, especially in the absence of quoted market values in an active market.53 Table of ContentsIndefinite-Lived Intangible AssetsThe fair values of the Coors brands in the Americas, the Miller brands in the U. S, the Carling brands in the U. K., and the Staropramen brands in EMEA & APAC continue to be sufficiently in excess of their respective carrying values as of the annual testing date, with each having over 15% cushion of fair value over book value.While cost inflation was high in all of our markets during the year ended December 31, 2022, the impact to COGS on a percentage basis was higher for our EMEA & APAC segment than our Americas segment.To the extent materials, transportation and energy prices continue to fluctuate, and if we are unable to mitigate the impact of supply chain constraints and inflationary pressures through price increases or other measures, our results of operations and financial condition could be materially adversely impacted.Coronavirus Global PandemicWe have been actively monitoring the impact of the coronavirus pandemic since it started at the end of the first quarter of 2020.We observed improvements in the marketplace related to the coronavirus global pandemic as on-premise locations began to re-open, with varying degrees of restrictions, across the world beginning in the second quarter of 2021.Items Affecting Americas Segment Results of OperationsGoodwill ImpairmentDuring the fourth quarter of 2022, we recorded a partial goodwill impairment charge of $845.0 million related to the Americas reporting unit as a result of the annual goodwill impairment analysis.Over the course of the third quarter of 2022, we recovered from the strike by rebuilding inventory and replenishing our retailers'shelves.As the brewery had not yet fully recovered until the end of the third quarter, results for the second and third quarters of 2022 were adversely impacted by this strike.Production at the Irwindale brewery ceased during the third quarter of 2020.Additionally, pursuant to the indenture dated July 7, 2016 ("July 2016 Indenture"), MCBC issued its outstanding 3.0% senior notes due 2026, 4.2% senior notes due 2046 and 1.25% senior notes due 2024.While we have some investments in prime money market funds at times, these are classified as cash and cash equivalents; however, we continually monitor the need for reclassification under the SEC requirements for money market funds, and the potential that the shares of such funds could have a net asset value of less than one dollar.As a result of the inherent uncertainty of these matters, the ultimate conclusion and actual cost of settlement may materially differ from our estimates.Goodwill and Intangible Asset ValuationWe evaluate the carrying value of our goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets for impairment at least annually or when an interim triggering event occurs that may indicate potential impairment.Our annual impairment test of goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets was performed as of October 1, the first day of the last fiscal quarter.Discount rates for the indefinite-lived intangible analysis by brand largely reflect the rates supporting the overall reporting unit valuation but may differ slightly to adjust for country or market specific risk associated with a particular brand, among other factors.While progress has been made on this strategy, including the increasing proportion of our above premium portfolio in the current year and the strengthening of our core brands, there is not enough historical data yet to comfortably predict future impacts and forecasted future cash flows are inherently at risk given that the strategies are still in progress.We measure and record the tax benefits from such a position based on the largest benefit that has a greater than 50% likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement.
