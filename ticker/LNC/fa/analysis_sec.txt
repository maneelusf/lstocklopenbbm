instances where the returns on our general account investments are not enough to support the interest rate guarantees on these products could have a material adverse effect on our businesses or results of operations.Generally, a decline in market interest rates could also reduce our return on investments that do not support particular policy obligations.If our businesses do not perform well and/or their estimated fair values decline or the price of our common stock does not increase, we may be required to recognize an impairment of our goodwill or to establish a valuation allowance against the deferred income tax asset, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition.Future reviews of goodwill could result in an impairment of goodwill, and such write-downs could have a material adverse effect on our net income and book value, although they would not affect the statutory capital of our insurance subsidiaries.Our management

when amortized, increases interest credited on the Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income (Loss).DFEL is a liability included within other contract holder funds on the Consolidated Balance

long-term or significant deviations from expected variable fund returns require a change to best estimate projections of EGPs and unlocking of DAC, VOBA, DSI, DFEL and changes in future contract benefits.Our long-term variable fund growth rate assumption, which is used in the determination of DAC, VOBA, DSI and DFEL amortization for the variable component of our variable annuity and VUL products, is an immediate increase of approximately 2% followed by growth going forward of 6.5% to 8.25% depending on the block of business and reflecting differences in contract holder fund allocations between fixed-income and equity-type investments.When actual credit-related investment losses are realized, we recognize a true-up to our DAC, VOBA, DSI and DFEL amortization and changes

insurance premiums and fees, investment income, maturities and sales of investments, issuance of debt or other types of securities and contract holder deposits.Holding Company Sources and Uses of Liquidity and Capital The primary sources of liquidity and capital at the holding company level are dividends and interest payments from subsidiaries, augmented by holding company short-term
