Volatility in oil, gas and NGL prices is due to a variety of factors that are beyond QEP's control, including: • changes in local, regional, domestic and foreign supply of and demand for oil, gas and NGL; • the impact of an abundance of oil, gas and NGL from unconventional sources on the global and local energy supply; • the level of imports and/or exports of, and the price of, foreign oil, gas and NGL; • localized supply and demand fundamentals, including the proximity, cost and availability of pipelines and other transportation facilities, and other factors that result in differentials to benchmark prices from time to time; • the availability of refining and storage capacity; • domestic and global economic and political conditions; • changes in government energy policies, including imposed price controls or product subsidies or both; • periods of civil unrest; • speculative trading in crude oil and natural gas derivative contracts; • the continued threat of terrorism and the impact of military and other action; • the activities of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) and other oil producing countries such as Russia and Saudi Arabia, including the ability of members of OPEC and Russia to maintain oil price and production controls; • events in the Middle East, Africa, South America and Russia; • the strength of the U. S. dollar relative to other currencies; • weather conditions, natural disasters and epidemic or pandemic disasters such as the recent outbreak of COVID-19; • domestic and international laws, regulations and taxes, including regulations, legislation or executive orders relating to climate change, induced seismicity or oil and gas exploration and production activities, including, but not limited to hydraulic fracturing; • technological advances affecting energy consumption and energy supply; • conservation efforts; • the price, availability and acceptance of alternative energy sources, including coal, nuclear energy, renewables and biofuels; • demand for electricity and natural gas used as fuel for electricity generation; • pandemic and health events that could reduce demand of petroleum products; • pandemic events that could impair our employees'and contractors'abilities to drill and produce oil and gas; • the level of global oil, gas and NGL inventories and exploration and production activity; and • the quality of oil and gas produced.Substantial or prolonged declines in these commodity prices may have the following effects on QEP's business: • adversely affect QEP's financial condition and liquidity and QEP's ability to finance planned capital expenditures, borrow money, repay debt and raise additional capital; • reduce the amount of oil, gas and NGL that QEP can produce economically; • reduce the carrying value of QEP's oil and gas properties due to recognizing additional impairments of proved and unproved properties; • cause QEP to delay, postpone or cancel some of its capital projects; • cause QEP to divest properties to generate funds to meet cash flow or liquidity requirements; • reduce QEP's revenues, operating income or cash flows; • limit QEP's ability to generate Free Cash Flow; • reduce the amounts of QEP's estimated proved oil, gas and NGL reserves; • limit QEP's access to, or increasing the cost of, sources of capital such as equity and long-term debt; • cause additional counterparty credit risk; • decrease the value of QEP's common stock; and • increase shareholder activism.There are operational risks associated with the exploration, production, gathering, transporting, and storage of oil, gas and NGL, including: • pandemic health events, injuries and/or deaths of employees, supplier personnel, or other individuals; • fires, explosions and blowouts; • earthquakes and other natural disasters; • aging infrastructure and mechanical problems; • unexpected drilling conditions, including abnormally pressured formations or loss of drilling fluid circulation; • pipe, cement or casing failures; • equipment malfunctions, mechanical failures or accidents; • theft or vandalism of oilfield equipment and supplies, especially in areas of increased activity; • adverse weather conditions; • plant, pipeline, railway and other facility accidents and failures; • truck and rail loading and unloading problems; • delays imposed by or resulting from compliance with regulatory requirements; • delays in or limits on the issuance of drilling permits on our federal leases, including as a result of government shutdowns; • delays imposed by or resulting from legal proceedings; • environmental accidents such as oil spills, natural gas leaks, pipeline or tank ruptures, or discharges of air pollutants, brine water or well fluids into the environment; • security breaches, cyberattacks, piracy, or terrorist acts; • flaring of natural gas, including, where required, accurate and timely payment of royalty on flared gas; • pipeline takeaway and refining and processing capacity issues; and • title problems.QEP faces competition from: • large multi-national, integrated oil companies; • U. S. independent oil and gas companies; • service companies engaging in oil and gas exploration and production activities; and • private investing in oil and gas assets.QEP faces competition in a number of areas such as: • acquiring desirable producing properties or new leases for future exploration; • acquiring or increasing access to gathering, processing and transportation services and capacity; • marketing its oil, gas and NGL production; • obtaining the equipment and expertise necessary to operate and develop properties; and • attracting and retaining employees with certain critical skills.Risks that we face while drilling horizontal wells include, but are not limited to, the following: • spacing of wells to maximize production rates and recoverable reserves; • landing the wellbore in the desired drilling zone; • staying in the desired drilling zone while drilling horizontally through the formation; • running casing the entire length of the wellbore; and • being able to run tools and other equipment consistently through the horizontal wellbore.Risks that we face while completing our wells include, but are not limited to, our inability to: • fracture stimulate the planned number of stages; • run tools the entire length of the wellbore during completion operations; • successfully clean out the wellbore after completion of the final fracture stimulation stage; • prevent unintentional communication with other wells; and • design and maintain efficient artificial lift throughout the life of the well.Future activist efforts could result in the following: • delay or denial of drilling and other necessary permits; • shortening of lease terms or reduction in lease size; • bans on hydraulic fracturing; • bans on crude oil and natural gas exports; • restrictions on installation or operation of gathering, processing or pipeline facilities; • restrictions on flaring of natural gas; • more stringent setback requirements from houses, schools, businesses and other improvements and landscape features; • towns, cities, states and counties imposing bans on certain activities, including hydraulic fracturing; • restrictions on the use of certain operating practices, such as hydraulic fracturing, or the disposition of related waste materials, such as hydraulic fracturing fluids and produced water; • reduced access to water supplies or restrictions on produced water disposal; • increased severance and/or other taxes; • cyberattacks; • legal challenges or lawsuits; • negative publicity about QEP; • disinvestment and other targeted activist shareholder campaigns; • increased costs of doing business; • reduction in demand for QEP's production; • other adverse effects on QEP's ability to develop its properties and increase production; • increased regulation of rail transportation of crude oil; • opposition to the construction of new oil and gas pipelines; • postponement of state and federal oil and gas lease sales; and • delays in or challenges to issuance of federal and tribal oil and gas leases.The existence of a material title deficiency can render a lease worthless.Failure to fund continued capital expenditures could adversely affect QEP's properties.QEP's certificate of incorporation authorizes its Board of Directors to issue preferred stock without shareholder approval.Any acquisition of a business or assets involves potential risks, including, among others: • incorrect estimates or assumptions about reserves, exploration potential or potential drilling locations; • incorrect assumptions regarding future revenues, including future commodity prices and differentials, or regardingfuture development and operating costs; • difficulty integrating the operations, systems, management and other personnel and technology of the acquired business or assets with QEP's own; • the assumption of unidentified or unforeseeable liabilities, resulting in a loss of value; • the inability to hire, train or retain qualified personnel to manage and operate QEP's growing business and assets; or • a decrease in QEP's liquidity to the extent it uses a significant portion of its available cash or borrowing capacity to finance acquisitions or operations of the acquired properties.Organizational modifications due to acquisitions, divestitures or other strategic changes can alter the risk and control environments; disrupt ongoing business; distract management and employees; increase expenses; result in additional liabilities, investigations and litigation; harm QEP's strategy; and adversely affect results of operations.QEP's success in divesting assets depends, in part, upon QEP's ability to identify suitable buyers or joint venture partners; assess potential transaction terms; negotiate agreements; and, if applicable, obtain required approvals.Such factors include, but are not limited to: current and forecasted commodity prices; current laws, regulations and permitting processes impacting oil and gas operations in the areas where the assets are located; covenants under QEP's credit agreement; tax impacts; willingness of the purchaser to assume certain liabilities such as asset retirement obligations and firm transportation contracts; QEP's willingness to indemnify buyers for certain matters; and other factors.QEP is required to pay fees to some of its midstream service providers based on minimum volumes regardless of actual volume throughput.In addition, QEP's commodity derivative transactions expose it to risk of financial loss if the counterparty fails to perform under a contract.Decisions regarding the payment of dividends are subject to a number of considerations, including: • cash available for distribution; • the Company's results of operations and anticipated future results of operations; • the Company's financial condition, especially in relation to the anticipated future capital needs; • the level of cash reserves the Company may establish to fund future capital expenditures; • the Company's stock price; and • other factors the board of directors deems relevant.For example, QEP depends on digital technologies to interpret seismic data; manage drilling rigs, production equipment and gathering systems; conduct reservoir modeling and reserves estimation; and process and record financial and operating data.This decrease was a result of a 33% decrease in average field-level prices and a 9% decrease in aggregate oil and condensate production volumes.The 21% decrease in NGL prices in 2020 compared to 2019 was primarily driven by a decrease in propane, ethane and other NGL component prices.65 Acquisitions and DivestituresQEP's strategy is to generate Free Cash Flow, and it believes its inventory of identified drilling locations provides a solid base to achieve its strategy, but it will continue to evaluate and potentially acquire properties in its operating areas to add additional development opportunities and facilitate the drilling of long lateral wells.Throughout the global pandemic, the Company has continued to take actions suggested by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention as well as state and local governments in the areas in which the Company operates to protect the core of its business and to ensure the health and safety of its employees, business partners and communities.While these decisions resulted in lower oil production during the year, the Company has started to see the market recover to pre-pandemic levels, and has added a second drilling rig to the Permian Basin to increase production in the area.The Company expects that the generation of Free Cash Flow, cash on hand, the AMT credit refunds and, as needed, borrowings made under its revolving credit facility will be sufficient to meet its liquidity needs for the next 12 months.The Company believes that the overall reduction of global spending on new development projects, especially in the U. S., will cause a reduction in the global oil supply, and that the eventual full recovery from the COVID-19 pandemic will cause demand to be more in line with previously anticipated levels and, consequently, continue to cause oil prices to improve.QEP uses commodity derivatives to reduce the volatility of the prices QEP receives for a portion of its production and to partially protect cash flow and returns on invested capital from a drop in commodity prices.Credit FacilityIn June 2020, QEP entered into the Eighth Amendment to its credit agreement, which, among other things, reduced the aggregate principal amount of commitments to $850.0 million, requires the Company's material subsidiaries to guarantee the obligations under the credit agreement, including certain swap obligations and modified the leverage ratio and present value financial covenants, such that they only pertain to net priority guaranteed debt (primarily consisting of borrowings under the credit facility and letters of credit).The amended credit agreement also provides the ability to use up to $500.0 million of loan proceeds to repurchase outstanding senior notes, provides the ability to issue subsidiary guarantees of up to $500.0 million of unsecured debt, with such guarantees being subordinated to the obligations under the credit agreement, and may limit the Company’ s ability to make certain restricted payments, including dividends.QEP typically enters into commodity derivative transactions covering a substantial, but varying, portion of its anticipated future oil and condensate and gas production for the next 12 to 24 months.
