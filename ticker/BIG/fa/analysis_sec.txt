Our insurance coverage is subject to deductibles, self-insured retentions, limits of liability and similar provisions that we believe are prudent based on our overall operations.In addition, we self-insure a significant portion of expected losses under our workers’ compensation, general liability, including automobile, and group health insurance programs.During 2022, we purchased approximately 28% of our products, at cost, directly from overseas vendors, including 19% from vendors located in China.Furniture products supplied by UFI to the Company represented approximately 6% of our merchandise purchases in 2022.We expect the assortment gaps related to the UFI closure to be fully mitigated by the end of the second quarter of 2023.Additionally, the net sales of cyclical product offerings in our Seasonal category may be threatened when we experience extended periods of unseasonable or extreme weather, including unseasonable weather caused by climate change.Growing concern over climate change has led policy makers in the U. S. to consider the enactment of legislative and regulatory proposals that would impose mandatory requirements on greenhouse gas emissions.We borrow funds under our $900 million five-year asset-based revolving credit facility (the“ 2022 Credit Agreement”), from time to time depending on operating or other cash flow requirements.In 2022 and continuing into 2023, the U. S. has experienced its highest level of inflation in decades.These factors include, but are not limited to: • Changes in governmental laws, case law and regulations, including changes that increase our effective tax rate, comprehensive tax reform, or other matters related to taxation; • Changes in accounting standards, including new interpretations and updates to current standards; • Events or circumstances could occur which could create bad publicity for us or for the types of merchandise offered in our stores which may negatively impact our business results including our sales; • Infringement of our intellectual property, including the Big Lots trademarks, could dilute their value; and • Other risks described from time to time in our filings with the SEC.Risk FactorsThe statements in this item describe material risks to our business and should be considered carefully.We rely on our ability to replenish depleted merchandise inventory through deliveries to our distribution centers and from the distribution centers to our stores by various means of transportation, including shipments by sea, rail and truck carriers.Additionally, as we seek to expand our operation through store count growth and advancement of our online retail capabilities, we may face increased or unexpected demands on distribution center operations, as well as new demands on our distribution network.• Operating (loss) profit decreased $501.3 million to an operating loss of $261.5 million in 2022, compared to an operating profit of $239.8 million in 2021.• Inventory decreased $89.8 million, or 7.3%, to $1,147.9 million.Net sales decreased $682.3 million, or 11.1%, to $5,468.3 million in 2022, compared to $6,150.6 million in 2021.Gross MarginGross margin dollars decreased $483.5 million, or 20.2%, to $1,913.5 million in 2022, compared to $2,397.0 million in 2021.Depreciation ExpenseDepreciation expense increased $12.3 million to $154.9 million in 2022 compared to $142.6 million in 2021.Operating (Loss) ProfitOperating loss was $261.5 million in 2022 compared to operating profit of $239.8 million in 2021.30 Table of ContentsInterest ExpenseInterest expense increased $11.0 million, to $20.3 million in 2022 compared to $9.3 million in 2021.We had total average borrowings of $421.3 million in 2022 compared to $148.5 million in 2021.Other Income (Expense) Other income (expense) was $1.4 million in 2022, compared to $1.3 million in 2021.Cash used in investing activities decreased $50.7 million to $108.9 million in 2022 compared to $159.7 million in 2021.While our net store count decreased compared to 2021, we experienced increased net sales in our new and relocated stores compared to our closed stores.The higher markdowns were driven by increased promotions in 2022 compared to 2021, as we aggressively discounted Seasonal and other products to drive net sales and reduce inventory levels in the second and third quarters of 2022.The higher initial markup was driven by modest price increases in targeted merchandise categories and on specific items that have been most impacted by higher freight costs.The increase in distribution and transportation costs was driven by increased fuel costs and outbound transportation rates, as well as the costs associated with our four forward distribution centers, two of which were opened in third quarter of 2021 and two of which were opened in 2022, partially offset by lower outbound and inbound carton volumes.During calendar 2022, we primarily relied on third-party services to perform physical inventory counts, but began testing counts performed by our own associates under supervision by field leadership.
