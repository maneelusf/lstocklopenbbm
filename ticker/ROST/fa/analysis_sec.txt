Refer to Management’ s Discussion and Analysis for a more complete identification and discussion of“ Forward-Looking Statements.”Various information systems are critical to our ability to operate and to manage key aspects of our business.The opportunity for dissemination of information, including inaccurate information, is seemingly limitless and readily available.Various governmental authorities regulate the quality and safety of merchandise we sell.Although no one store accounts for more than one percent of our sales, our corporate headquarters, Los Angeles buying office, nine distribution centers/warehouses, and approximately 22% of our stores are located in California.Our growth strategy is based on successfully expanding our off-price model in current markets and in new geographic regions.The increasing sophistication of cybercriminals, the increased potential for cyberattacks, and the advances in computer capabilities and remote access increases these risks.Government authorities in affected regions have in the past taken actions, sometimes drastic, including mandatory capacity restrictions, reduced operating hours, and closure of retail operations, in an effort to slow down the spread of the disease.While they have generally been peaceful, in some locations they have been accompanied by violence, damage to retail stores, and the loss of merchandise.Any material interruption in our computer systems could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations.Any such disruptions could negatively impact our financial performance or financial condition.This was primarily due to all store locations remaining open throughout fiscal 2021, compared to the negative impact from the COVID-19 related closures of all of our stores during a significant portion of the March 2020 to June 2020 period.Cost of goods sold in fiscal 2021 increased $3.9 billion compared to fiscal 2020 mainly due to higher sales, given that all our stores were open throughout fiscal 2021, compared to the negative impact from the COVID-19 related closures of all of our stores during a significant portion of the March 2020 to June 2020 period.The higher diluted earnings per share in fiscal 2021 was primarily attributable to all our store locations remaining open throughout fiscal 2021, compared to the negative impact from the COVID-19 related closures of all of our stores during a significant portion of the March 2020 to June 2020 period.A third party administers the program; our responsibility is limited to making payment on the terms originally negotiated with the supplier, regardless of whether the supplier sells its receivable to a financial institution.For fiscal 2021, SG & A increased $371.2 million compared to fiscal 2020.Diluted earnings per share in fiscal 2021 was $4.87 compared to $0.24 in fiscal 2020.Operating ActivitiesNet cash provided by operating activities was $1.7 billion in fiscal 2022.Net cash provided by operating activities was $1.7 billion in fiscal 2021.Net cash provided by operating activities was $2.2 billion in fiscal 2020.Net cash provided by financing activities was $1.7 billion in fiscal 2020.Cost of goods sold as a percentage of sales for fiscal 2022 increased approximately 210 basis points from fiscal 2021 primarily due to a 130 basis point decline in merchandise margin primarily due to higher ocean freight costs and increased markdowns, an 85 basis point increase in distribution expenses primarily due to the timing of packaway inventory carrying costs and the deleveraging effect from the opening of our Brookshire, Texas distribution center, a 30 basis point deleverage in occupancy costs, and a 25 basis point increase in domestic freight costs primarily due to higher fuel costs.We expect incentive compensation expenses to return to target levels in fiscal 2023 and for domestic and ocean freight costs to decrease.The increase was primarily due to all our stores remaining open throughout fiscal 2021 compared to the impact from the COVID-19 related closures of all of our stores during a significant portion of the March 2020 to June 2020 period, and to the opening of 64 net new stores during fiscal 2021, partially offset by approximately $240 million in long-term debt refinancing costs incurred in fiscal 2020.The increase in cash used for investing activities in fiscal 2022 compared to fiscal 2021 was primarily due to higher capital expenditures related to the construction of 99 new stores compared to 65 in the prior year, the refresh and enhancement of our existing stores, the construction of our Buckeye, Arizona distribution center, and the investments in various information technology systems, partially offset by the lower expenditures related to our Brookshire, Texas distribution center which opened in the first quarter of fiscal 2022.The increase in our planned capital expenditures for fiscal 2023 compared to fiscal 2022 is primarily driven by investments in our next distribution centers, existing store improvements, information technology systems, and various expenditures related to distribution centers, and buying and corporate offices.
