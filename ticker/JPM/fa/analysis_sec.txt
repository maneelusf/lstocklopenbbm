JPMorgan Chase is subject to heightened oversight and scrutiny from regulatory authorities in many jurisdictions.Readers should not consider any descriptions of these factors to be a complete set of all potential risks that could affect the Firm.However, the FDIC has not formally adopted a single point of entry resolution strategy.However, there is no assurance that JPMorgan Chase’ s credit ratings will not be lowered in the future.There is no assurance that further inappropriate or unlawful actions by employees have not occurred or will not occur, lead to a violation of the terms of these resolutions (and associated consequences), or that any such actions will always be detected, deterred or prevented.There is no assurance that those actions will not result in resolutions or other enforcement actions against JPMorgan Chase.Furthermore, U. S. government officials have demonstrated a willingness to bring criminal actions against financial institutions and have required that institutions plead guilty to criminal offenses or admit other wrongdoing in connection with resolving regulatory investigations or enforcement actions.Because governmental policies in one jurisdiction may differ or conflict with those in other jurisdictions, JPMorgan Chase may face negative consequences regardless of the course of action it takes or elects not to take, including: • restrictions or prohibitions on doing business within a particular jurisdiction, or with governmental entities in a jurisdiction • the threat of enforcement actions, including under antitrust or other anti-competition laws, rules and regulations, and • harm to its reputation arising from public criticism, including from politicians, activists and other stakeholders.Furthermore, JPMorgan Chase's participation in or association with certain social and environmental industry groups or initiatives could be viewed by activists or governmental authorities as boycotting or other discriminatory business behavior.In addition, sustained low growth, low or negative interest rates, inflationary pressures or recessionary conditions could diminish customer demand for the products and services offered by JPMorgan Chase’ s consumer businesses.JPMorgan Chase could also become involved in litigation and other types of disputes with clients, customers, counterparties and investors as a consequence of the transition from U. S. dollar LIBOR and other benchmark rates to replacement rates, including claims that JPMorgan Chase has: • treated clients, customers, counterparties or investors unfairly, or caused them to experience losses, higher financing costs or lower returns on investments • failed to appropriately communicate the effects of the transition from benchmark rates on the products that JPMorgan Chase has sold to its clients and customers, or failed to disclose purported conflicts of interest • made inappropriate product recommendations to or investments on behalf of its clients, or sold products that did not serve their intended purpose, in connection with the transition from benchmark rates • engaged in anti-competitive behavior, or in the manipulation of markets or specific benchmarks, in connection with the discontinuation of or transition from benchmark rates, or • disadvantaged clients, customers, counterparties or investors when interpreting or making determinations under the terms of agreements or financial instruments.Furthermore, the widespread and expanding interconnectivity among financial institutions, clearing banks, CCPs, payments processors, financial technology companies, securities exchanges, clearing houses and other financial market infrastructures increases the risk that the disruption of an operational system involving one institution or entity, including due to a cyber attack, may cause industry-wide operational disruptions that could materially affect JPMorgan Chase’ s ability to conduct business.These types of laws, rules and regulations could prohibit or significantly restrict financial services firms such as JPMorgan Chase from transferring information across national borders or sharing information among affiliates or with third parties such as vendors, thereby increase compliance costs, or could restrict JPMorgan Chase’ s use of personal information when developing or offering products or services to customers.Further, should extraordinary events or the factors that cause or contribute to those events become more chronic, the disruptive effects of those events on JPMorgan Chase’ s business and operations, and on its clients, customers, counterparties and employees, could become more significant and long-lasting.JPMorgan Chase’ s failure to appropriately assess and manage these relationships, especially those involving significant banking functions, shared services or other critical activities, could materially adversely affect JPMorgan Chase.Climate-related physical risks include the increased frequency or severity of acute weather events, such as floods, wildfires and tropical storms, and chronic shifts in the climate, such as persistent changes in precipitation levels, rising sea levels, or increases in average ambient temperature.These instances of misconduct have resulted in litigation, and resolutions of governmental investigations or enforcement actions involving consent orders, deferred prosecution agreements, non-prosecution agreements and other civil or criminal sanctions.Social and environmental activists have been increasingly targeting JPMorgan Chase and other financial services firms with public criticism concerning their business practices, including business relationships with clients that are engaged in certain sensitive industries, such as companies: • whose products are or are perceived to be harmful to human health, or • whose activities negatively affect or are perceived to negatively affect the environment, workers’ rights or communities.A failure or perceived failure to appropriately address conflicts of interest or fiduciary obligations could result in customer dissatisfaction, litigation and regulatory fines, penalties or other sanctions, and heightened regulatory scrutiny and enforcement actions, all of which can lead to lost revenue and higher operating costs and cause serious harm to JPMorgan Chase’ s reputation.Aggressive actions by hostile governments or groups, including armed conflict or intensified cyber attacks, could expand in unpredictable ways by drawing in other countries or escalating into full-scale war with potentially catastrophic consequences, particularly if one or more of the combatants possess nuclear weapons.Some of these countries have in the past experienced economic disruptions, including: • extreme currency fluctuations • high inflation • low or negative growth, and • defaults or reduced ability to service sovereign debt.The governments in these countries have sometimes reacted to these developments by imposing restrictive policies that adversely affect the local and regional business environment, such as: • price, capital or exchange controls, including imposition of punitive transfer and convertibility restrictions or forced currency exchange • expropriation or nationalization of assets or confiscation of property, including intellectual property, and • changes in laws, rules and regulations.In addition, emerging markets countries, as well as more developed countries, have been susceptible to unfavorable social developments arising from poor economic conditions or governmental actions, including: • widespread demonstrations, civil unrest or general strikes • crime and corruptionPart I • security and personal safety issues • an outbreak or escalation of hostilities, or other geopolitical instabilities • overthrow of incumbent governments • terrorist attacks, and • other forms of internal discord.JPMorgan Chase is named as a defendant or is otherwise involved in many legal proceedings, including class actions and other litigation or disputes with third parties.
