We face intense price competition in all areas of our business.Many aspects of our business potentially involve substantial liability risks.Competitors may develop market trading platforms that are more competitive than ours.Competitors may leverage data more effectively or enter into strategic partnerships, mergers or acquisitions that could make their trading, listings, clearing, data or technology businesses more competitive than ours.Given our position in the global securities industry, we may be more likely than other companies to be a direct target, or an indirect casualty, of such events.Any actual cost savings and synergies may be lower than we expect and may take a longer time to achieve than we anticipate, and we may fail to realize the anticipated benefits of acquisitions.Other potential purchasers of assets in our industry may have greater financial resources than we have.32 Our businesses operate in various international markets, including certain emerging markets that are subject to greater political, economic and social uncertainties than developed countries.Given our position in the global capital markets, we may be more likely than other companies to be a target for malicious disruption activities.We may be required to recognize impairments of our goodwill, intangible assets or other long-lived assets in the future.We assess goodwill and intangible assets, as well as other long-lived assets, including equity method investments, equity securities, and property and equipment, for potential impairment on an annual basis or more frequently if indicators of impairment arise.During the fourth quarter of 2022, the remaining amount of the $102 million was accelerated and paid to the eligible former Verafin employees.Substantially all of our foreign subsidiaries operate in functional currencies other than the U. S. dollar.A hypothetical 100 basis points increase in interest rates on our outstanding commercial paper would increase our annual interest expense by approximately $7 million based on borrowings as of December 31, 2022.Index revenues increased in 2022 compared with 2021 and 2021 compared with 2020.Occupancy expense decreased in 2022 compared with 2021 primarily due to a favorable impact from foreign exchange rates.Marketing and advertising expense decreased in 2022 compared with 2021, reflecting lower IPO activity.Regulatory expense decreased in 2022 compared with 2021 due to a charge in 2021 associated with an administrative fine issued by the SFSA.Goodwill is allocated to our reporting units based on the assignment of the fair values of each reporting unit of the acquired company.Accordingly, goodwill was reassigned based on relative fair value of each reporting unit.We perform our goodwill impairment test at the reporting unit level.In performing a quantitative impairment test, we compare the fair value of each reporting unit and indefinite-lived intangible asset with their respective carrying amounts.If the carrying amounts of the reporting unit or the indefinite-lived intangible asset exceed their respective fair values, an impairment charge is recognized in an amount equal to the difference, limited to the total amount of goodwill allocated to that reporting unit or the total carrying value of the indefinite-lived intangible asset.In conducting the quantitative assessment, we determined that the fair value of our goodwill for each of our reporting units and the fair value of our indefinite-lived intangible assets sufficiently exceed their respective carrying amounts.If our forecasts of cash flows or other key inputs are negatively revised in the future, the estimated fair value of each reporting unit and of our indefinite-lived intangible assets would be adversely impacted, potentially leading to an impairment in the future that could materially affect our operating results.
