This total continuing production level represents a decrease of 1,156 BOE/d (2%) compared to total continuing production levels in the fourth quarter of 2019 and a decrease of 2,530 BOE/d (4%) compared to first quarter of 2019 continuing production.As a result of these actions, along with reduced capital and workover spend, we expect production to decline from the first quarter to the second quarter.Oil and Natural Gas RevenuesOur oil and natural gas revenues during the three months ended March 31, 2020 decreased 22% compared to these revenues for the same period in 2019.Compared to the fourth quarter of 2019, lease operating expenses decreased $6.7 million (6%) on an absolute-dollar basis primarily due to lower company and contract labor, but decreased $0.47 (2%) on a per-BOE basis due to lower production in the first quarter of 2020.Primarily as a result of adding these additional costs to the amortization base, we recognized a full cost pool ceiling test write-down of $72.5 million during the three months ended March 31, 2020.We recognized net income of $74.0 million, or $0.14 per diluted common share, during the first quarter of 2020, compared to a net loss of $25.7 million, or $0.06 per diluted common share, during the first quarter of 2019.Our goal is to increase the value of our properties through a combination of exploitation, drilling and proven engineering extraction practices, with the most significant emphasis relating to CO2 enhanced oil recovery operations.The Company currently anticipates that the bank group will complete the redetermination process over the next several weeks, and it is currently uncertain if there will be any change to the borrowing base or banks’ commitment levels.However, declining industry conditions and reductions in our cash flows and liquidity over the past few months have made our ability to comply with the maximum permitted ratio of total net debt to consolidated EBITDAX maintenance financial covenant in our senior secured bank credit facility increasingly unlikely if these conditions continue, and we foresee the potential to be in violation of this covenant by the end of the second or third quarter of this year.However, declining industry conditions and reductions in our cash flows and liquidity over the past few months have made our ability to comply with the maximum permitted ratio of total net debt to consolidated EBITDAX maintenance financial covenant in our senior secured bank credit facility increasingly unlikely if these conditions continue, and we foresee the potential to be in violation of this covenant by the end of the second or third quarter of this year.Collectively, the above factors, along with the materially adverse change in industry market conditions and our cash flow over the past few months, have substantially diminished our ability to repay, refinance, or restructure our $584.7 million outstanding principal balance of 2021 Senior Secured Notes and have raised substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern.This 2020 capital expenditure amount of between $95 million to $105 million, which was revised on March 31, 2020, excluding capitalized interest and acquisitions, is an $80 million, or 44%, reduction from the late-February 2020 estimate of between $175 million and $185 million in response to the more than 50% decline in NYMEX WTI prices during March 2020 as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, which worsened an already deteriorated oil market that resulted from the early-March 2020 failure by the group of oil producing nations known as OPEC + to reach an agreement over proposed oil production cuts, and continuing uncertainty about their combined economic impact, especially on oil demand and prices.These events have worsened a deteriorated oil market which followed the early-March 2020 failure by the group of oil producing nations known as OPEC + to reach an agreement over proposed oil production cuts.Commodity Derivative Contracts The following table summarizes the impact our crude oil derivative contracts had on our operating results for the three months ended March 31, 2020 and 2019: In order to provide a level of price protection to a portion of our oil production, we have hedged a portion of our estimated oil production through 2020 using both NYMEX and LLS fixed-price swaps and three-way collars.Future interest payable related to our 2021 Senior Secured Notes and 2022 Senior Secured Notes is accounted for in accordance with FASC 470-60, Troubled Debt Restructuring by Debtors, whereby most of the future interest was recorded as debt as of the transaction date, which will be reduced as semiannual interest payments are made.These debt discounts will be amortized as interest expense over the terms of the notes; therefore, future interest expense reflected in our Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations will be higher than the actual cash interest payments on our 7¾% Senior Secured Notes and 2024 Convertible Senior Notes by approximately $16 million in 2020, $19 million in 2021, $21 million in 2022, $25 million in 2023 and $21 million in 2024.The current income tax benefits for the three months ended March 31, 2020 and 2019, represent amounts estimated to be receivable resulting from alternative minimum tax credits and certain state tax obligations.Among the factors that could cause actual results to differ materially are our ability to comply with the maximum permitted ratio of total net debt to consolidated EBITDAX maintenance financial covenant in our senior secured bank credit facility and the related impact on our ability to continue as a going concern, our ability to refinance our senior debt maturing in 2021 and the related impact on our ability to continue as a going concern, the outcome of any discussions with our lenders and bondholders regarding the terms of a potential restructuring of our indebtedness or recapitalization of the Company and any resulting dilution for our stockholders, fluctuations in worldwide oil prices or in U. S. oil prices and consequently in the prices received or demand for our oil and natural gas; evolving political and military tensions in the Middle East; decisions as to production levels and/or pricing by OPEC or production levels by U. S. shale producers in future periods; levels of future capital expenditures; trade disputes and resulting tariffs or international economic sanctions; effects and maturity dates of our indebtedness; success of our risk management techniques; accuracy of our cost estimates; access to and terms of credit in the commercial banking or other debt markets; fluctuations in the prices of goods and services; the uncertainty of drilling results and reserve estimates; operating hazards and remediation costs; disruption of operations and damages from well incidents, hurricanes, tropical storms, forest fires, or other natural occurrences; acquisition risks; requirements for capital or its availability; conditions in the worldwide financial, trade and credit markets; general economic conditions; competition; government regulations, including changes in tax or environmental laws or regulations; and unexpected delays, as well as the risks and uncertainties inherent in oil and gas drilling and production activities or that are otherwise discussed in this quarterly report, including, without limitation, the portions referenced above, and the uncertainties set forth from time to time in our other public reports, filings and public statements including, without limitation, the Company’ s most recent Form 10-K. 38
