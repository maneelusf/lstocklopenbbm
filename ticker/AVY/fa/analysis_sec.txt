RISK FACTORS There have been no material changes to the risk factors included in Part I, Item 1A, of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended January 1, 2022 that have not been disclosed in our periodic filings with the SEC, except as set forth below.The demand for our products is impacted by the effects of, and changes in, worldwide economic, social, political and market conditions, which could have a material adverse effect on our business.Macroeconomic developments such as impacts from COVID-19, inflation, raw material, freight and labor availability, slower growth in the geographic regions in which we operate and uncertainty in the global credit or financial markets leading to a loss of consumer confidence could result in a material adverse effect on our business as a result of, among other things, reduced consumer spending, declines in asset valuations, diminished liquidity and credit availability, volatility in securities prices, credit rating downgrades and fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates.We have operations in over 50 countries and our domestic and international operations are strongly influenced by matters beyond our control, including changes in political, social, economic and labor conditions, tax laws (including U. S. taxes on foreign earnings), and international trade regulations (including tariffs), as well as the impact of these changes on the underlying demand for our products.
