The Companies may be subject to new laws, regulations or other requirements or the revision or reinterpretation of such requirements, which could adversely affect them.Changes to tax laws, regulations or interpretations thereof could have a material adverse impact on the Companies.The Companies’ results of operations can be affected by circumstances or events that are beyond their control.The Companies may also be subject to penalties from other regulatory agencies.State utility regulators can initiate proceedings to prohibit the Utilities from recovering from their customers the cost of service (including energy costs and storm restoration costs) that the regulators determine to have been imprudently incurred (see "Other Regulatory Matters" in Note B to the financial statements in Item 8).The occurrence of such events could also adversely affect the cost and availability of insurance.CECONY may also be impacted by regulations requiring reductions in air emissions.Item 1A: Risk

their rate plans.Accounting for ContingenciesThe accounting rules for contingencies apply to an existing condition, situation or set of circumstances involving uncertainty as to possible loss that will ultimately be resolved when one or more future events occur or fail to occur.Additionally, if the projects in which Con Edison holds these investments recognize an impairment, Con Edison may record its proportionate share of that impairment loss and would evaluate its investment for an other-than-temporary decline in value.Higher interest rates have resulted in, and are expected to continue to result in, increased interest expense on commercial paper and variable-rate debt.
