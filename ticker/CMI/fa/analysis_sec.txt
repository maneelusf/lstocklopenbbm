Risk FactorsSet forth below and elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K are some of the principal risks and uncertainties that could cause our actual business results to differ materially from any forward-looking statements contained in this Report and could individually, or in combination, have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial position and cash flows.As of December 31, 2022, we had no inventory and approximately $14 million of receivables in Russia, all of which are fully reserved.At December 31, 2022, we employed approximately 73,600 persons worldwide.The broader consequences of this conflict, which may include further sanctions, embargoes, regional instability, and geopolitical shifts; potential retaliatory action by the Russian government against companies, including possible nationalization of foreign businesses in Russia; increased tensions between the United States and countries in which we operate; and the extent of the conflict’ s effect on our business and results of operations as well as the global economy, cannot be predicted.See NOTE 14, "PRODUCT WARRANTY LIABILITY" to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.Whether or not the separation is completed, our businesses may face material challenges in connection with this transaction, including, without limitation: • the diversion of management’ s attention from ongoing business concerns and impact on our businesses as a result of the devotion of management’ s attention to strategic alternatives for the filtration business, including the separation; • maintaining employee morale and retaining key management and other employees; • retaining existing business and operational relationships, including with customers, suppliers, employees and other counterparties, and attracting new business and operational relationships; • execution and related risks in connection with financing transactions undertaken in connection with the separation; • foreseen and unforeseen dis-synergy costs, costs of restructuring transactions (including taxes) and other significant costs and expenses; and • any potential negative reactions from the financial markets resulting from the separation.These risks include: • public health crises, including the spread of a contagious disease, such as future pandemics or epidemics, quarantines or shutdowns related to public health crises, and other catastrophic events; • economic and political instability, including international conflicts, war, acts of terrorism or the threat thereof, political or labor unrest, civil unrest, riots or insurrections; • the difficulty of enforcing agreements and collecting receivables through foreign legal systems; • trade protection measures and import or export licensing requirements; • the imposition of taxes on foreign income and tax rates in certain foreign countries that exceed those in the U. S.; • the imposition of tariffs, exchange controls or other restrictions; • difficulty in staffing and managing widespread operations and the application of foreign labor regulations; • required compliance with a variety of foreign laws and regulations; and • changes in general economic and political conditions, including changes in relationship with the U. S., in countries where we operate, particularly in China and emerging markets.Such risks and uncertainties include: • reputational harm, including damage to our relationships with customers, suppliers, investors, governments or other stakeholders; • adverse impacts on our ability to sell and manufacture products; • the success of our collaborations with third parties; • increased risk of litigation, investigations or regulatory enforcement action; • unfavorable ESG ratings or investor sentiment; • diversion of resources and increased costs to control, assess and report on ESG metrics; • our ability to achieve our goals, commitments and targets within the timeframes announced; • access to and increased cost of capital and • adverse impacts on our stock price.We are subject to income taxes in the U. S. and numerous international jurisdictions.As the result of changing market conditions, a large percentage of our salaried employees continue to work remotely full or part-time.We accrued $30 million for the RAM recall during the first quarter of 2022, an amount that reflected our current estimate of the cost of that recall.We accrued $29 million for the Titan recall during the third quarter of 2022, an amount that reflected our current estimate of the cost of that recall.Due to the international scope of our operations, we are subject to a complex system of commercial and trade regulations around the world.We suspended our commercial operations in Russia indefinitely, which resulted in a charge of $111 million during 2022 related to these actions.For 2022, we recognized $349 million of equity, royalty and interest income from investees, compared to $506 million in 2021.We believe we made adequate provisions for income taxes for all years that are subject to audit based upon the latest information available.We account for our pension programs in accordance with employers'accounting for defined benefit pension plans, which requires that amounts recognized in financial statements be determined using an actuarial basis.The increases in net income attributable to Cummins Inc. and earnings per diluted share were driven by higher net sales and increased gross margin, partially offset by higher selling, general and administrative expenses (including Meritor acquisition and integration costs and costs associated with the planned separation of our filtration business), increased research, development and engineering expenses, lower equity, royalty and interest income from investees (primarily in China), costs associated with the suspension of our Russian operations, losses in corporate owned life insurance, increased interest expense related to new borrowings and higher intangible asset amortization resulting from our acquisitions.• Power Systems segment sales increased 14 percent primarily due to favorable pricing and higher demand in power generation markets in Latin America, North America and India and stronger demand in industrial markets with higher aftermarket sales and increased oil and gas demand in North America and China.These increases were partially offset by unfavorable foreign currency fluctuations of 2 percent of total sales, primarily in the Euro, Chinese renminbi, British pound and Indian rupee.The decrease in selling, general and administrative expenses as a percentage of sales was due mainly to net sales increasing at a faster rate than the increase in selling, general and administrative expenses.The following were the primary drivers by market: • Medium-duty truck and bus sales increased $683 million mainly due to favorable pricing and higher demand (including higher aftermarket sales), especially in North America.These increases were partially offset by the following: • Electronics and fuel systems sales decreased $107 million principally due to weaker demand in China, partially offset by higher demand in North America.Segment EBITDADistribution segment EBITDA increased $157 million, primarily due to higher volumes, partially offset by unfavorable foreign currency fluctuations (principally in emerging market currencies, South African rand, Australian dollar and Japanese yen), costs associated with the suspension of our Russian operations, increased freight costs due to supply chain constraints, higher compensation expenses and an inventory write-off.Financial data for the New Power segment was as follows: New Power segment sales increased 71 percent principally due to higher electrified components sales, traction sales since the completion of the Meritor and Siemens CVP acquisitions and improved sales of fuel cells and electrolyzers.The higher working capital requirements resulted in a cash outflow of $1.0 billion compared to a cash outflow of $359 million in the comparable period in 2021, mainly due to decreased accrued expenses (as a result of lower variable compensation accruals in 2022) and higher accounts receivable due to increased sales, partially offset by a lower spend in inventories and favorable changes in accounts payable.The effect of exchange rate changes on cash and cash equivalents increased $15 million, primarily due to favorable fluctuations in the British pound, partially offset by unfavorable fluctuations in the Chinese renminbi.The loss is primarily due to unfavorable asset returns, partially offset by higher discount rates in the U. S. and U. K. 57 Table of ContentsThe table below sets forth the net periodic pension (income) cost for the years ended December 31 and our expected cost for 2023.We expect 2023 net periodic pension income to increase compared to 2022, primarily due to the full year benefit of the Meritor pension plans added during the acquisition and a higher estimated return on assets in the U. S. and U. K. The decrease in net periodic pension cost in 2022 compared to 2021 was primarily due to higher discount rates in the U. S. and U. K. and favorable actuarial experience in the U. S., partially offset by a lower expected rate of return in the U. K. The decrease in net periodic pension cost in 2021 compared to 2020 was due to favorable actuarial experience and investment returns, partially offset by lower discount rates in the U. S. and U. K. The weighted-average discount rates used to develop our net periodic pension cost are set forth in the table below.
