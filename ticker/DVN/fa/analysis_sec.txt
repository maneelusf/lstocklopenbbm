Such volatility is likely to continue in the future due to numerous factors beyond our control, including, but not limited to: • the domestic and worldwide supply of and demand for oil, gas and NGLs, including the impact of releases from the U. S. Strategic Petroleum Reserve; • volatility and trading patterns in the commodity-futures markets; • climate change incentives and conservation and environmental protection efforts; • production levels of members of OPEC, Russia, the U. S. or other producing countries; • geopolitical risks, including the on-going conflict between Russia and Ukraine, as well as other political and civil unrest in the Middle East, Africa, Europe and South America; • adverse weather conditions, natural disasters, public health crises and other catastrophic events, such as tornadoes, earthquakes, hurricanes and epidemics of infectious diseases; • regional pricing differentials, including in the Delaware Basin and other areas of our operations; • differing quality of production, including NGL content of gas produced; • the level of imports and exports of oil, gas and NGLs and the level of global oil, gas and NGL inventories; 15 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements • the price and availability of alternative energy sources; • technological advances affecting energy consumption and production, including with respect to electric vehicles; • stockholder activism or activities by non-governmental organizations to restrict the exploration and production of oil and natural gas in order to reduce GHG emissions; • the overall economic environment, including inflationary pressures and rising interest rates; • changes in trade relations and policies, such as restrictions on oil, gas and NGL exports by the U. S. or economic sanctions, including embargoes, on Russia or other producing countries, as well as the imposition of tariffs by the U. S. or China; and • other governmental regulations and taxes.21 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements The Credit Risk of Our Counterparties Could Adversely Affect Us We enter into a variety of transactions that expose us to counterparty credit risk.Drilling for oil, gas and NGLs can be unprofitable, not only from dry holes, but from productive wells that do not return a profit because of insufficient revenue from production or high costs.Declines in commodity prices and overruns in budgeted expenditures are common risks that can make a particular project uneconomic or less economic than forecasted.For example, the EPA released rule proposals during 2021 and 2022 that if adopted would, among other things, (i) broaden methane and volatile organic compounds emission reduction requirements for certain oil and gas facilities, including a zero-emission standard for pneumatic controllers, and (ii) impose standards to eliminate venting of associated gas, and require capture and sale of gas where sale line is available, at new and existing oil wells.Although commodity prices subsequently recovered after their decline in 2020, COVID-19, its variants or any other future pandemic could lead to similar protracted periods of depressed commodity prices or result in other significant adverse consequences to our business.22 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements Although we have experienced cybersecurity incidents from time to time, none have had a material effect on our business, operations or reputation.Our business requires significant capital to find and acquire new reserves.We also maintain workers’ compensation and employer’ s liability insurance.Although it is not possible at this time to predict the outcome of these or other proposals, any new restrictions on hydraulic fracturing that may be imposed in areas in which we conduct business could potentially result in increased compliance costs, delays or cessation in development or other restrictions on our operations.Competition is also prevalent in the marketing of oil, gas and NGLs.Reduced demand from the COVID-19 pandemic and management of production levels from OPEC + caused WTI pricing to decrease more than 60% during the first quarter of 2020.We recently declared a dividend payable in the first quarter of 2023 for $579 million, which includes an 11% increase to our fixed quarterly dividend to $0.20 per share.• Including variable dividends, paid dividends of approximately $3.4 billion in 2022 and have declared $579 million of dividends to be paid in the first quarter of 2023, which is inclusive of an 11% increase to our fixed quarterly dividend to $0.20 per share.We remain committed to continuing our track record of industry leading return of capital to our shareholders, underpinned by low capital reinvestment rates and a disciplined, returns-driven strategy which is designed to be successful through 29 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements economic cycles.Current market fundamentals indicate that even though the supply-demand balance for commodities is expected to remain tight due to growing demand and continued discipline by oil producers, market prices for crude oil and natural gas are expected to be lower in 2023 due to ongoing recession fears driven by high inflation levels and rising interest rates.Our 2023 cash flow is partly protected from commodity price volatility due to our current hedge position that covers approximately 25% of our anticipated oil volumes and 20% of our anticipated gas volumes.To achieve our 2023 capital program objectives that maximize free cash flow, approximately 60% of our 2023 spend is expected to be allocated to our highest margin U. S. oil play, the Delaware Basin.This includes the credit risk related to customers who purchase our oil, gas and NGL production, the collection of receivables from joint interest owners for their proportionate share of expenditures made on projects we operate and counterparties to our derivative financial contracts.The Senior Credit Facility matures on October 5, 2024, with the option to extend the maturity date by two additional one-year periods subject to lender consent.In addition to the fixed quarterly dividend, we may pay a variable dividend up to 50% of our excess free cash flow, which is a non-GAAP measure.Management also considers the nature of 40 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements production, common infrastructure, common sales points, common processing plants, common regulation and management oversight to make common operating field determinations.Further, in the event we were to undergo an“ ownership change” (as defined in Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended), our ability to use net operating losses and tax credits generated prior to the ownership change may be limited.
