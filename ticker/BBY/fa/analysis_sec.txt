These risks have included or may in the future continue to include: (i) significant reductions in customer visits to, and spending at, our stores; (ii) significant disruptions to our supply chain; (iii) fluctuating consumer spending, particularly in light of the provision of government stimulus funds; (iv) novel changes to our operations, such as the roll-out of contactless, curbside pick-up for our goods, (v) the implementation of safety standards by various state and federal agencies; (vi) risks related to the shift in channels in which customers choose to engage us, such as by switching to online shopping, which may affect our profitability; and (vii) our ability to finance our operations.If we fail to interpret, predict and react to these changes in a timely and effective manner, the consequences can include: failure to offer the products and services that our customers want; excess inventory, which may require heavy discounting or liquidation; inability to secure adequate access to brands or products for which consumer demand exceeds supply; delays in adapting our merchandising, marketing or supply chain capabilities to accommodate changes in product trends; and damage to our brand and reputation.Assessing the viability of new ventures is typically subject to significant uncertainty, and the success of such new ventures can be adversely affected by many factors, including, for example: • different and incremental business and other risks of the new venture not identified in our diligence assessments; • failure to attract, motivate and retain key employees of the new venture; • uncertainty of forecasting financial performance; • failure to integrate aspects of the new venture into our existing business, such as new product or service offerings or information technology systems; • failure to maintain appropriate internal controls over financial reporting; • failure to generate expected synergies, such as cost reductions; • unforeseen changes in the business environment of the new venture; • disputes or strategic differences with key employees or other third-party participants in the new venture; and • adverse impacts on relationships with vendors and other key partners of our existing business or the new venture.Such factors include, for example: • changing patterns of customer consumption and behavior, particularly in light of an evolving omnichannel environment; • our ability to adjust store operating models to adapt to these changing patterns; • the location and appropriate number of stores, supply chain and other facilities in our portfolio; • the interior layout, format and size of our stores; • the products and services we offer at each store; • the local competitive positioning, trade area demographics and economic factors for each of our stores; • the primary term lease commitment and long-term lease option coverage for each store; and • the occupancy cost of our stores relative to market rents.The factors that can adversely affect these aspects of our operations include, but are not limited to: • interruptions to our delivery capabilities; • failure of third parties to meet our standards or commitments; • disruptions to our systems and the need to implement new systems; • limitations in capacity; • global supply chain impacts that could hinder our vendors’ ability to meet our demand for product volumes and timing; • increased levels of inventory loss due to organized crime, theft or damage; • risk to our employees and customers arising from burglary or robbery from our stores or other facilities; • consolidation or business failures in the transportation and distribution sectors; • labor strikes, slow-downs or labor shortages, including as a result of an increasingly competitive job market, affecting our stores or impacting ports or any other aspect of our supply chain; • diseases, pandemics (including COVID-19), outbreaks and other health-related concerns; and • increasing transportation costs.As an employer of more than 90,000 people in a large number of different jurisdictions, we are subject to risks related to employment laws and regulations including, for example: • the organization of unions and related rules that affect the nature of labor relations, changes to which the National Labor Relations Board frequently considers; • laws that impact the relationship between the company and independent contractors and the classification of employees and independent contractors; and • laws that impact minimum wage, sick time, paid leave and scheduling requirements that could directly or indirectly increase our payroll costs and/or impact the level of service we are able to provide.Some of the most significant compliance and litigation risks we face include, but are not limited to: • the difficulty of complying with sometimes conflicting statutes and regulations in local, national or international jurisdictions; • the potential for unexpected costs related to compliance with new or existing environmental legislation or international agreements affecting energy, carbon emissions, electronics recycling and water or product materials; • the challenges of ensuring compliance with applicable product compliance laws and regulations with respect to both the products we sell and contract to manufacture, including laws and regulations related to product safety and product transport; • the financial, operational and business impact of evolving regulations governing data privacy and security, including limitations on the collection, use or sharing of information; consumer rights to access, delete or limit/opt-out of the use of information; or litigation arising from new private rights of action; • the impact of other new or changing statutes and regulations including, but not limited to, financial reform; National Labor Relations Board rule changes; healthcare reform; contracted worker labor laws; corporate governance matters; escheatment rules; rules governing pricing, content, distribution, copyright, mobile communications, electronic device certification or payment services; and/or other future legislation that could affect how we operate and execute our strategies as well as alter our expense structure; • the impact of litigation, including class-action lawsuits involving consumers and shareholders, and labor and employment matters; and • the impact of changes in the federal executive and legislative branches on the development, or changes in, laws, regulations and policies, such as economic, fiscal, tax, retail, labor and social policies.In addition, our International operations also expose us to other risks, including those related to, for example: • political conditions and geopolitical events, including war and terrorism; • economic conditions, including monetary and fiscal policies and tax rules, as well as foreign exchange rate risk; • rules governing international trade and potential changes to trade policies or trade agreements and ownership of foreign entities; • government-imposed travel restrictions or warnings, whether in response to the COVID-19 pandemic or otherwise, and differing responses of governmental authorities to pandemics and other global events; • cultural differences that we may be unable to anticipate or respond to appropriately; • different rules or practices regarding employee relations, including the existence of works councils or unions; • difficulties in enforcing intellectual property rights; and • difficulties encountered in exerting appropriate management oversight to operations in remote locations.The risks described below highlight potential events, trends or other circumstances that could adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows, liquidity or access to sources of financing and, consequently, the market value of our common stock and debt instruments.These consequences could have a material adverse impact on our profitability, cash flows and liquidity.We face a heightened risk of cybersecurity attacks or data security incidents and are more dependent on internet and telecommunications access and capabilities.The principal sources of our liquidity are funds generated from operating activities, available cash and liquid investments, credit facilities, other debt arrangements and trade payables.Revenue from acquisitions is included in comparable sales beginning with the first full quarter following the first anniversary of the date of the acquisition.Our fiscal year ends on the Saturday nearest the end of January.In fiscal 2023, digital sales comprised 33% of our Domestic revenue compared to 19% in fiscal 2020.Online revenue of $14.2 billion decreased 13.5% on a comparable basis in fiscal 2023.• Appliances: The 5.7% comparable sales decline was driven primarily by large appliances.• Appliances: The 0.3% comparable sales growth was driven by small appliances.• Entertainment: The 8.6% comparable sales decline was driven primarily by gaming and virtual reality.• Services: The 2.1% comparable sales decline was driven primarily by warranty services.Substantially all open purchase orders are fulfilled within 30 days.The level of vendor funding deferral has remained relatively stable over the last three fiscal years.The level of markdown adjustments has remained relatively stable over the last three fiscal years.
