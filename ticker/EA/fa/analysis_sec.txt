In periods of transition, sales of products for legacy generation consoles typically slow or decline in response to the introduction of new consoles, and sales of products for new generation consoles typically stabilize only after new consoles are widely-established with the consumer base.Substantially all of our office locations, including our global headquarters in Redwood Shores, California and key studios across North America, Europe and Asia remain closed to the majority of our employees.Strengthening of the U. S. dollar, particularly relative to the Euro, British pound sterling, Australian dollar, Japanese yen, Chinese yuan, South Korean won and Polish zloty, has a negative impact on our reported international net revenue but a positive impact on our reported international operating expenses (particularly when the U. S. dollar strengthens against the Swedish krona and the Canadian dollar) because these amounts are translated at lower rates.The market price of our common stock historically has been, and we expect will continue to be, subject to significant fluctuations.These broad market fluctuations could adversely affect the market price of our common stock.Additionally, receivables from these partners generally increase in our December fiscal quarter as sales of our products generally increase in anticipation of the holiday season which exposes us to heightened risk at that time of year.Our business model includes revenue that we deem recurring in nature, such as revenue from our annualized sports franchises (e. g., FIFA, Madden NFL), our console, PC and mobile catalog titles (i. e., titles that did not launch in the current fiscal year), and our live services.For our fiscal year ended March 31, 2021, international net revenue comprised 56 percent of our total net revenue, and we expect our international business to continue to account for a significant portion of our total net revenue.We are subject to taxes in the United States and in various foreign jurisdictions.In particular, enactment of the recently proposed U. S. tax legislation could materially impact our provision for income taxes and cash taxes.51 Table of ContentsWe may not meet our product and live service development schedules and key events, sports seasons and/or movies that are tied to our product and live service release schedule may be delayed, cancelled or poorly received.If we fail to appropriately respond to the dissemination of such content, we may be subject to lawsuits and governmental regulation, our players may not engage with our products and services and/or may lose confidence in our brands and our financial results may be adversely affected.A console, system or device for which we are developing products and services may not succeed as expected or new consoles, systems or devices may take market share and interactive entertainment consumers away from those for which we have devoted significant resources.Alternatively, a console, system or device for which we have not devoted significant resources could be more successful than we initially anticipated, causing us to not be able to reach our intended audience and take advantage of meaningful revenue opportunities.Further, disruptions in the financial markets, economic downturns, poor business decisions, or reputational harm may adversely affect our business partners and they may not be able to continue honoring their obligations to us or we may cease our arrangements with them.Alternative arrangements and services may not be available to us on commercially reasonable terms or we may experience business interruptions upon a transition to an alternative partner or vendor.These trends from fiscal year 2021 may not be indicative of results for future periods, particularly as factors related to the COVID-19 pandemic lessen and consumers can engage with other forms of entertainment, if the trend towards digital adoption decelerates, or if global macroeconomic effects related to the COVID-19 pandemic persist even after the pandemic has subsided.If we are not able to flexibly respond to and manage the impact of these and other currently unknown impacts related to the COVID-19 pandemic, our business will be harmed.If we or our external business partners were to experience an event that caused a significant system outage, disruption or degradation or if a transition among data centers or service providers or an upgrade or maintenance session encountered unexpected interruptions, unforeseen complexity or unplanned disruptions, our products and services may not be available to consumers or may not be delivered reliably and stably.A significant percentage of our digital net revenue is attributable to sales of products and services through our significant partners, including Sony, Microsoft, Apple and Google.These vendors and business partners may not prevent data security breaches with respect to the information we provide them or fully enforce our policies, contractual obligations and disclosures regarding the collection, use, storage, transfer and retention of personal data.If we breach any of these covenants and do not obtain a waiver from the lenders or noteholders, then, subject to applicable cure periods, our outstanding indebtedness may be declared immediately due and payable.32 Table of ContentsFinancial ResultsOur key financial results for our fiscal quarter ended September 30, 2021 were as
