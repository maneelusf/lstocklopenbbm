The principal sources of our liquidity are funds generated from operating activities, available cash and cash equivalents, borrowings under the Amended Credit Agreement and supplier and vendor financing.In the event of any decrease in the amount of or appraised value of these assets or upon the disposition of assets, our borrowing capacity under either the ABL Facility or the FILO Facility, would similarly-40-Table of Contentsdecrease, which could adversely impact our business and liquidity.As the closures are completed, we expect our borrowing capacity under both the ABL Facility and FILO Facility may decrease to the extent sales and cash flow levels decrease following such store closures.Without giving effect to the notice of acceleration described above, our Amended Credit Agreement provides for a $1.130 billion asset-based revolving credit facility (which shall be automatically and permanently reduced to (i) $1.030 billion on March 1, 2023 and (ii) $1.000 billion on August 30, 2023) and a $375 million first-in-last-out term loan credit facility.Refer to Part I, Item 1A,“ Risk Factors,” of our 2021 Form 10-K, filed on April 21, 2022 with the SEC, and the information contained in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q and our other reports and registration statements filed with the SEC.The search for permanent replacements could also result in significant recruiting and relocation costs, as well as increased salary and benefit costs.Any inability to generate or obtain sufficient levels of liquidity to meet our cash requirements at the level and times needed would have a material adverse impact on our business and financial position.In addition, we continue to consider all strategic alternatives including restructuring or refinancing our debt, seeking additional debt or equity capital, reducing or delaying our business activities and strategic initiatives, or selling assets, other strategic transactions and/or other measures, including obtaining relief under the U.

Bankruptcy Code.As of November 26, 2022, the Company had (i) $550.0 million of borrowings outstanding under the ABL Facility and $186.2 million of outstanding letters of credit issued thereunder and (ii) $375.0 million of outstanding borrowings under the FILO Facility.Also, we have had a reduction in force, including an approximately 20% reduction across corporate and supply chain associates.Selling, General and Administrative ExpensesSG & A for the three months ended November 26, 2022 was $583.6 million, or 46.4% of net sales, compared with $698.0 million, or 37.2% of net sales, for the three months ended November 27, 2021.This plan is focused on strengthening the Company’ s financial position through additional liquidity and a reduction of its cost structure, better serving its customers through merchandising, inventory and customer engagement, and regaining our authority in the Home and Baby markets.• Comparable Sales * for the three months ended November 26, 2022 decreased by approximately 32.0% compared to a decrease of approximately 7.0% for three months ended November 27, 2021.Comparable Sales the three months ended November 27, 2021 decreased by approximately 7.0%.During the first quarter of fiscal 2022, we completed this program, repurchasing approximately 2.3 million shares of our common stock.This resulted in the repurchase of 5.0 million shares in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2020, and an additional 0.2 million shares received upon final settlement in the first quarter of fiscal 2021.Domestics merchandise includes categories such as bed linens and related items, bath items and kitchen textiles.The increase in SG & A as a percentage of net sales for the three and nine months ended November 26, 2022 was primarily due to the impact of de-leveraging of SG & A due to the declines in net sales noted above.The change in operating loss as a percentage of net sales for three months ended November 26, 2022 was primarily due to the decline in gross margin, as discussed above, as well as higher impairment charges compared to the three months ended November 27, 2021.The change in operating loss as a percentage of net sales for nine months ended November 26, 2022 was primarily due to the decline in gross margin, as discussed above, as well as higher restructuring and transformation initiative expenses and higher impairment charges compared to the nine months ended November 27, 2021.For the three and nine months ended November 26, 2022, the increase in interest expense, net was primarily driven by an increase in borrowings and higher interest rates against our ABL and FILO facilities and finance lease liabilities.
