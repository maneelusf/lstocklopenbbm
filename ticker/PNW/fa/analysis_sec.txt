On February 10, 2020, two ACC Commissioners filed two sets of draft proposed retail electric competition rules.See Note 3 for a discussion of the Navajo Plant and Cholla retirement and the related risks associated with APS’ s continued recovery of its remaining investment in the plant.In expressing concerns about the environmental and climate-related impacts from continued extraction, transportation, delivery and combustion of fossil fuels, environmental advocacy groups and other third parties have in recent years undertaken greater efforts to oppose the permitting, construction, 40 Table of Contents and operation of fossil fuel infrastructure projects.Some of these systems are managed, hosted, provided, or used for third parties to assist in conducting our business.If our short-term ratings were to be lowered, it could severely limit access to the commercial paper market.For example, under the Energy Policy Act of 2005, FERC can impose penalties (approximately $1.2 million per day per violation) for failure to comply with mandatory electric reliability standards.APS is also required to have numerous permits, approvals and certificates from these agencies.APS must also meet certain distributed renewable energy requirements.Retail customers in APS’ s service territory increased 2.1% for the year ended December 31, 2022, compared with the prior-year period.Retail electricity sales in kWh, adjusted to exclude the effects of weather variations, increased 2.4% for the year ended December 31, 2022, compared with the prior-year period.This projected sales growth range includes the impacts of several large data centers and new large manufacturing facilities, which are expected to contribute to average annual growth in the range of 3.5% to 5.5% through 2025.Climate change is also projected to exacerbate such drought conditions.We believe that we will maintain sufficient access to these financial markets.APS will file its required TE progress reports on March 15 and September 15, 2023, along with a 2024 TE Plan later this year.On September 22, 2022, the DOE opened applications for the up to $7 billion program to create six to ten regional clean hydrogen hubs across the country.70 Table of Contents Pinnacle West’ s Consolidated Statement of Income for the year ended December 31, 2022 includes an after-tax loss of $12.8 million relating to this impairment.Operating Results–2022 compared with 2021 Our consolidated net income attributable to common shareholders for the year ended December 31, 2022, was $484 million, compared with $619 million for the prior year.All other income and expenses, net were $38 million lower for the year ended December 31, 2022, compared to the prior-year period primarily due to the Ocotillo modernization and Four Corners SCR debt deferrals that ended upon the 2019 Rate Case effective date.For the year ended December 31, 2022, Pinnacle West’ s total dividends paid per share of common stock were $3.42 per share, which resulted in dividend payments of $379 million.For example, APS maintains its inventory to take advantage of lower pricing, when available, and to minimize supply chain delays that can increase the pricing due to expediting fees.Additionally, APS has proactively entered into long-term contracts to hedge against price volatility, which has allowed it to mitigate several procurement spend areas such as transformers.The Internal Revenue Service and U. S. Treasury are expected to issue regulations and other guidance which will provide additional details and clarifications regarding how the Company may be able to claim each of these credits.Raw material shortages, rising inflation, COVID-19 related work force disruptions and natural disasters continue to place increased pressure on the global supply chain.APS has measures in place to continually monitor and evaluate resource needs and supply chain adequacy but cannot predict whether there will be material supply chain shortages in the future.In addition, APS is actively seeking to include future facility purchase options in its PPAs that will enable investments with greater financial flexibility.In May 2022, APS issued an RFP to address resource needs for 2025 and beyond.Once it secures those important resources and closes out the 2022 RFP, APS intends to issue its next RFP to address future resource needs.In addition, the ACC ordered extensive compliance and reporting obligations and will be continuing to explore whether penalties or rebates would be owed to certain customers.Capital expenditures will be funded with internally generated cash and external financings, which may include issuances of long-term debt and Pinnacle West common stock.The remainder of the investment will be contributed by El Dorado as investments are selected by AZ-VC. Key Financial Drivers In addition to the continuing impact of the matters described above, many factors influence our financial results and our future financial outlook, including those listed below.As we add new generating units and continue with improvements and expansions to our existing generation, transmission, and distribution facilities in future years, we anticipate property taxes may increase, though these increases will continue to be partially offset by the impacts of the recent legislative changes noted above.Capital expenditures will be funded with internally generated cash and external financings, which may include issuances of long-term debt and Pinnacle West common stock.Failure to comply with such covenant levels would result in an event of default which, generally speaking, would require the immediate repayment of the debt subject to the covenants and could“ cross-default” other debt.Any downward revision or withdrawal may adversely affect the market price of Pinnacle West’ s or APS’ s securities and/or result in an increase in the cost of, or limit access to, capital.80 Table of Contents Contractual ObligationsPinnacle West has contractual obligations and other commitments that will need to be funded in the future, in addition to its capital expenditure programs.Regulatory liabilities generally represent amounts collected in rates to recover costs expected to be incurred in the future or amounts collected in excess of costs incurred and are refundable to customers.If future recovery of costs ceases to be probable, the assets would be written off as a charge in current period earnings, except for pension benefits, which would be charged to OCI and result in lower future earnings.
