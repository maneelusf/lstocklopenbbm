The Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act also authorized the U. S. government to award grants for CCUS research, development and demonstration; carbon transport and storage infrastructure and permitting; carbon utilization and market development; and carbon removal.Motions to dismiss are pending in the legal challenge to the lease sale.Strict liability can render Occidental or its subsidiaries liable for damages without regard to their degree of care or fault.Any of these risks could adversely affect Occidental’ s ability to conduct operations or result in substantial losses as a result of: ■ Damage to and destruction of property and equipment, including property and equipment owned by third-parties which its operations rely upon; ■ Damage to natural resources; ■ Pollution and other environmental damage, including spillage or mishandling of recovered chemicals or fluids; ■ Regulatory investigations, fines and penalties; ■ Loss of well location, acreage, expected production and related reserves; ■ Suspension or delay of its operations; ■ Substantial liability claims; and ■ Significant repair and remediation costs that increase its break-even economics.These factors include, among others: ■ Worldwide and domestic supplies of, and demand for, oil, NGL, natural gas and refined products; ■ The cost of exploring for, developing, producing, refining and marketing oil, NGL, natural gas and refined products; ■ Operational impacts such as production disruptions, technological advances and regional market conditions, including available transportation capacity and infrastructure constraints in producing areas; ■ Changes in weather patterns and climate; ■ The impacts of the members of OPEC and other non-OPEC member-producing nations that may agree to and maintain production levels; ■ The ongoing global impact of the Russia-Ukraine war; ■ The worldwide military and political environment, including uncertainty or instability resulting from an escalation or outbreak of armed hostilities or acts of terrorism in the United States or elsewhere; ■ The price and availability of and demand for alternative and competing fuels and emissions reducing technology; ■ Technological advances affecting energy consumption and supply; ■ Government policies and support and market demand for low-carbon technologies; ■ Domestic and international governmental regulations and taxes, including those that restrict the export of hydrocarbons; ■ Shareholder activism or activities by non-governmental organizations to restrict the exploration, development and production of oil, NGL and natural gas; ■ Additional or increased nationalization and expropriation activities by international governments; ■ The impact and uncertainty of world health events, including the COVID-19 pandemic and the spread of new variants; ■ The effect of releases from the U. S. Strategic Petroleum Reserve; ■ Volatility in commodity markets; ■ The effect of energy conservation efforts; and ■ Global inventory levels and general economic conditions.Prolonged or substantial decline, or sustained market uncertainty, in these commodity prices may have the following effects on Occidental’ s business: ■ Adversely affect Occidental’ s financial condition, results of operations, liquidity, ability to reduce debt, access to and cost of capital, and ability to finance planned capital expenditures, pay dividends and repurchase shares; ■ Reduce the amount of oil, NGL and natural gas that Occidental can produce economically; ■ Cause Occidental to delay or postpone some of its capital projects; ■ Reduce Occidental’ s revenues, operating income or cash flows; ■ Reduce the amounts of Occidental’ s estimated proved oil, NGL and natural gas reserves; ■ Reduce the carrying value of Occidental’ s oil and natural gas properties due to recognizing impairments of proved properties, unproved properties and exploration assets; ■ Reduce the standardized measure of discounted future net cash flows relating to oil, NGL and natural gas reserves; and ■ Adversely affect the ability of Occidental’ s partners to fund their working interest capital requirements.In its development and exploration activities, Occidental bears the risks of: ■ Equipment failures; ■ Construction delays; ■ Escalating costs or competition for services, materials, supplies or labor; ■ Increasing prices as a result of broad inflation ■ Property or border disputes; ■ Disappointing drilling results or reservoir performance; ■ Title problems and other associated risks that may affect its ability to profitably grow production, replace reserves and achieve its targeted returns; ■ Actions by third-party operators of its properties; ■ Permit delays and costs of drilling wells on lands subject to complex development terms and circumstances; and ■ Oil, NGL and natural gas gathering, transportation and processing availability, restrictions or limitations.These factors include, but are not limited to, the following: ■ Uncertain or volatile political, social, and economic conditions; ■ Social unrest, acts of terrorism, war, or other armed conflict; ■ Public health crises and other catastrophic events, such as the COVID-19 pandemic; ■ Confiscatory taxation or other adverse tax policies; ■ Theft of, or lack of sufficient legal protection for, proprietary technology and other intellectual property; ■ Unexpected changes in legal and regulatory requirements, including changes in interpretation or enforcement of existing laws; ■ Restrictions on the repatriation of income or capital; ■ Currency exchange controls; ■ Inflation; and ■ Currency exchange, rate fluctuations and devaluations.Occidental has many competitors (including national oil companies), some of which: (i) are larger and better funded; (ii) may be willing to accept greater risks; (iii) have greater access to capital; (iv) have substantially larger staffs; or (v) have special competencies.Certain Occidental subsidiaries conduct offshore operations primarily in the Gulf of Mexico and their operations and financial results are vulnerable to certain unique risks associated with operating offshore, including conditions relating to the following: ■ Hurricanes and other adverse weather conditions; ■ Geological complexities and water depths associated with such operations; ■ Limited number of partners available to participate in projects; ■ Oilfield service costs and availability; ■ Compliance with HSE and other laws and regulations; ■ Terrorist attacks or piracy; ■ Remediation and other costs and regulatory changes resulting from oil spills, emissions or releases of hazardous substances or materials; ■ Failure of equipment or facilities; and ■ Response capabilities for personnel, equipment or environmental incidents.In January 2022, the U. S. District Court for the District of Columbia invalidated the results of the BOEM oil and gas lease sale 257 in the Gulf of Mexico, in which an Occidental subsidiary was the high bidder on 30 additional new blocks located nearby to its existing host platforms, ruling that the BOEM’ s environmental analysis of GHG emissions was inadequate under NEPA.In January 2021, the COGCC adopted new regulations that impose siting requirements or“ setbacks” on certain oil and gas drilling locations based on the distance of a proposed well pad to occupied structures.This comprehensive plan will support nine well pads and approximately 140 new wells and will provide for substantial future development in a geographically remote area on Colorado’ s eastern plains.While, as of December 31, 2022, Occidental is permitted, or had permit applications submitted to applicable regulatory agencies, for nearly all planned 2023 drilling and completions activity in the DJ Basin, any significant delays could result in changes to our development program in the DJ Basin and our ability to establish new proved undeveloped locations by meeting the SEC’ s“ reasonably certain” threshold for adding PUD reserves.In 2016, the Toxic Substances Control Act (TSCA) was amended to expand the EPA’ s authority to evaluate and regulate new and existing chemicals.In June 2021, Congress and President Biden reinstated the methane provisions of EPA’ s 2012 and 2016 regulations, an action that Occidental supported.In November 2021, the White House Office of Domestic Climate Policy issued a U. S. Methane Emissions Reduction Action Plan that solicited public comment on the EPA’ s proposed framework to expand federal regulation of methane and volatile organic compound emissions from a broader set of new upstream and midstream oil and gas operations, as well as various existing operations.Oil production from Occidental’ s CO2 EOR projects depends largely on having access to sufficient amounts of naturally occurring or anthropogenic (human-made) CO2.The IRS audited Anadarko’ s tax position regarding the deductibility of the payment and in September 2018 issued a statutory notice of deficiency rejecting Anadarko’ s refund claim.As of the date of this filing, Occidental’ s long-term debt was rated BB + by Fitch Ratings, Ba1 by Moody’ s Investors Service and BB + by Standard and Poor’ s.It is expected that the price of oil will be volatile for the foreseeable future given the current geopolitical risks, the ongoing global impact of the Russia-Ukraine war, and uncertainty around the global economy, oil demand in China as it emerges from its zero-COVID policy, production levels in OPEC and non-OPEC oil producing countries and further releases from or additions to the US Strategic Petroleum Reserve.The Zero Coupons can next be put to Occidental in October 2023, which, if put in whole, would require a payment of approximately $344 million at such date.Occidental anticipates that a higher percentage of excess free cash flow is expected to be allocated to shareholder returns in 2023 with the intention to begin redeeming the preferred stock.These goals include achieving net-zero GHG emissions (i) from its operations and energy use before 2040, with an ambition to do so before 2035, and (ii) from its total carbon inventory, including the use of its sold products, with an ambition to do so before 2050.Occidental is pursuing multiple pathways to fund these projects including project financing, long-term carbon removal or CCUS agreements, and identifying business opportunities with stakeholders in carbon-intensive industriesKEY PERFORMANCE INDICATORSOccidental seeks to meet its strategic goals by continually measuring its success against key performance indicators that drive total stockholder return.In addition to efficient capital allocation and deployment discussed below in the section titled Oil and Gas Segment-Business Strategy, Occidental believes its most significant performance indicators are: OPERATIONAL ■ Total spend per barrel-In 2023, Occidental will continue to focus on controlling total costs from a per-barrel perspective.In 2022, Occidental declared commerciality for Block 65 and invested capital of $362 million across all of the Oman blocks to drill 92 wells and execute facilities projects to support development and EOR activities.Net PUD reserves are those volumes that are expected to be recovered from new wells on undrilled acreage, or from existing wells where a relatively major expenditure is required for recompletion.For purposes of the current capital plan, Occidental will continue to focus on allocating capital to high return assets with the flexibility to adjust based on fluctuations in commodity prices.SOURCES AND USES OF CASHOccidental currently expects its operational cash flows and cash on hand to be sufficient to meet its current debt maturities and other obligations for the next 12 months from the date of this filing.■ Occidental values debt using market-observable information for debt instruments that are traded on secondary markets.In these circumstances, the affected subsidiary evaluates the financial viability of other parties with whom it is alleged to be jointly liable, the degree of their commitment to participate and the consequences to such subsidiary of their failure to participate when estimating its ultimate share of liability.
