Several factors influence our effective income tax rate, including tax laws and regulations, the related interpretations, and our ability to sustain our reporting positions on examination.For example, there have been periodic closings and ship diversions, labor disputes, and congestion disrupting U. S. ports, including in California where we receive a significant portion of the products we source from outside the U. S. We have from time to time made alternative arrangements to continue the flow of inventory as a result of supply chain disruptions in the U. S. and other countries.Conversely, overestimating replenishment capacity needs could result in inefficient deployment of capital.A large portion of the merchandise that we offer is sourced, directly or indirectly, from outside the U. S., with China as our single largest source.We have historically experienced loss of inventory (also called shrink) due to damage, theft (including from organized retail crime), and other causes.In addition, providing multiple fulfillment options and implementing new technology is complex, costly, and may not meet our guests’ expectations.If any of our merchandise offerings do not meet applicable safety standards or Target's or our guests’ expectations regarding safety, supply chain transparency, and responsible sourcing, we could be exposed to legal and reputational risks and our results of operations could be adversely affected.We attempt to differentiate our guest experience through a careful combination of price, merchandise assortment, store environment, convenience, guest service, loyalty programs, and marketing.Negative incidents involving us, our workforce, or others with whom we do business could quickly erode trust and confidence and result in consumer boycotts, workforce unrest or walkouts, government investigations, and litigation.Underestimating our replenishment capacity needs could result in lower in-stock levels or increased costs for temporary storage.Our systems are subject to possible damage or interruption from many events, including power outages, telecommunications failures, malicious attacks, security breaches, and implementation errors.
