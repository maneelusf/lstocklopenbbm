Our health care costs also are affected by external events that we cannot forecast or project and over which we have little or no control, including changes in laws and regulations, as well as pandemics, costly new treatments, new treatment guidelines, provider billing practices, inflation and changes in customers'health care utilization patterns, which may, among other things, impact our ability to appropriately document their health conditions.If we fail to develop and maintain satisfactory relationships with health care payers, physicians, hospitals and other health service providers and with producers and consultants, our business and results of operations may be adversely affected.In addition, arrangements between payors and pharmaceutical manufacturers have been the subject of debate in federal and state legislatures and various other public and governmental forums.We must continue to invest in and maintain long-term solutions that will enable us to anticipate customer needs and expectations, enhance the customer experience, act as a differentiator in the market and protect against cybersecurity risks and threats or other events that could disrupt our information technology systems such as man-made or natural disasters (including those as a result of climate change).Unauthorized access, acquisition, use, disclosure or dissemination of confidential and proprietary information about our business and strategy could also negatively affect the achievement of our strategic initiatives.We also rely on the internal controls and financial reporting controls of joint venture entities and other entities in which we invest and their failure to maintain effectiveness or comply with applicable standards may materially and adversely affect us.Responses to such scenarios have and may include, among other things, making temporary policy changes, such as waiving various medical requirements, assisting with replacement medications, transferring prescriptions and expanding our help line.Existing or future laws and rules could also require or lead us to take other actions such as changing our business practices, and could increase our liability.Our pharmacy services operations are subject to the clinical quality, patient safety and other risks inherent in the dispensing, packaging and distribution of drugs, including claims related to purported dispensing and other operational errors.There also continues to be heightened review by federal and state regulators of business and reporting practices within the health services industry, including with respect to claims payment and related escheat practices, and increased scrutiny by other federal and state governmental agencies (such as state attorneys general) empowered to bring criminal actions in circumstances that could have previously given rise only to civil or administrative proceedings.We also use aggregated and anonymized data for research and analysis purposes, and in some cases, provide access to such de-identified data, or analytics created from such data, to pharmaceutical manufacturers and third-party data aggregators and analysts.Compliance with existing or new privacy, security and data laws, regulations and requirements may result in increased operating costs, and may constrain or require us to alter our business model or operations.A downgrade in the financial strength ratings of our insurance subsidiaries could adversely affect new sales and retention of current business, and a downgrade in our debt ratings would increase the cost of borrowed funds and could negatively affect our ability to access capital.Many factors, including geopolitical issues, future economic downturns, man-made disasters, natural disasters (including those as a result of climate change) and pandemics, availability and cost of credit and other capital and consumer spending can negatively impact the U. S. and global economies.• Operating leases ◦ These include operating lease payments of $494 million.◦ We expect $114 million of operating lease payments to be due within the next twelve months beginning January 1, 2023.◦ We expect $85 million of other liabilities to be paid within the next twelve months beginning January 1, 2023.The increase in other long-term investments of $0.2 billion since December 31, 2021 is primarily driven by net additional funding activity partially offset by the effects of completing the Chubb transaction during the third quarter of 2022 (see Note 4 to the Consolidated Financial Statements).Income from our limited partnership investments is generally reported on a one quarter lag due to the timing of when financial information is received from the general partner or manager of the investments.Our primary market risk exposures changed significantly since December 31, 2021 as a result of completing the Chubb transaction during the third quarter 2022, as described in Note 4 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.74 The decrease in the effect of this hypothetical change in interest rates is a result of decreases in the fair value of our debt securities and long-term debt since December 31, 2021, as well as disposals associated with completing the Chubb transaction during the third quarter of 2022, see Note 4 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further details.See Part I, Item 1 of this Form 10-K for definitions of Cigna Healthcare's market segments.See Part 1, "Business-Regulation" section of this Form 10-K for further discussion of Star Ratings.Our pension plans were overfunded by $238 million and reported in Other assets in our Consolidated Balance Sheets as of December 31, 2022.◦ As of December 31, 2022, purchase obligations consisted of a total of $6.5 billion of estimated payments required under contractual arrangements.See Part I, Item 1 of this Form 10-K for definitions of Cigna Healthcare's market segments.Commercial Mortgage LoansAs of December 31, 2022, our $1.6 billion commercial mortgage loan portfolio consisted of approximately 50 fixed-rate loans, diversified by property type, location and borrower.
