Maintaining and continually enhancing the value of our Company and our private brand merchandise is important to the success of our business.There is no assurance that we will be able to reverse any decline in traffic or that increases in eCommerce sales will offset any decline in store traffic.There is no assurance that we will be able to obtain additional financing on favorable terms or at all.There can be no assurance that any of these actions would be successful, sufficient or available on favorable terms.There can be no assurances, however, that our hedging activity will be effective in insulating us from the risks associated with changes in interest rates.Similarly, shipping to alternative ports in the United States could result in increased lead times and transportation costs.There is no assurance that any appeal we undertake in these or other circumstances would be successful, nor is there any assurance that we will continue to comply with the other NYSE continued listing standards.In addition, the perceived decreased value of employee equity incentive awards may reduce their effectiveness in encouraging performance and retention.The most significant assumptions relate to the capital markets, interest rates and other economic conditions.This depends to a great extent on our ability to retain, attract and motivate talented employees throughout the organization, many of whom, particularly in the stores, are in entry level or part-time positions, which have historically had high rates of turnover.Our operations are dependent upon the integrity, security and consistent operation of various systems and data centers, including the point-of-sale systems in the stores, our eCommerce platforms, data centers that process transactions, communication systems and various software applications used throughout our Company to source merchandise, track inventory flow, process transactions, generate performance and financial reports and administer payroll and benefit plans.Our ability to obtain any additional financing or any refinancing of our debt, if needed at any time, depends upon many factors, including our existing level of indebtedness and restrictions in our debt facilities, historical business performance, financial projections, the value and sufficiency of collateral, prospects and creditworthiness, external economic conditions and general liquidity in the credit and capital markets.Two critical assumptions used to estimate pension income or expense for the year are the expected long-term rate of return on plan assets and the discount rate.In March 2020, we borrowed $1.25 billion under the Revolving Credit Facility.We offer a wide range of apparel and home merchandise from a portfolio of private, exclusive and national brands.23 Table of Contents 2019 Summary 24 Table of ContentsResults of OperationsEffective February 3, 2019, we adopted ASU 2016-02, Leases (Topic 842), as amended.We define free cash flow as cash flow from operating activities, less capital expenditures and dividends paid, plus the proceeds from the sale of operating assets.During both 2019 and 2018, private brand merchandise comprised 46% of total merchandise sales.Exclusive brand merchandise comprised 6% and 7% of total merchandise sales in 2019 and 2018, respectively.The applicable rate for standby and import letters of credit were 1.75% and 0.875%, respectively, while the commitment fee was 0.375% for the unused portion of the Revolving Credit Facility.For 2019, the discount rate to measure pension expense was 4.33% compared to 3.98% in 2018.We ended the year with $386 million of cash and cash equivalents, an increase of $53 million from the prior year.The carrying value is adjusted to the new carrying value and any subsequent increases in fair value are not recorded.Additionally, due to the implementation of the new lease accounting standard, approximately $20 million in expenses in 2019 related to the Company's home office lease, which were previously classified as elements of interest and depreciation and amortization, are now included in SG & A. Depreciation and Amortization ExpensesDepreciation and amortization expense in 2019 decreased $12 million to $544 million, or 2.2%, compared to $556 million in 2018.(Gain)/Loss on Extinguishment of Debt During the first quarter of 2018, we settled cash tender offers with respect to portions of our outstanding 8.125% Senior Notes Due 2019 (2019 Notes) and 5.65% Senior Notes Due 2020 (2020 Notes), resulting in a loss on extinguishment of debt of $23 million.The most significant estimates are permanent reductions to retail prices (markdowns) and permanent devaluation of inventory (markdown accruals) used primarily to clear seasonal merchandise or otherwise slow-moving inventory and inventory shortage (shrinkage).
