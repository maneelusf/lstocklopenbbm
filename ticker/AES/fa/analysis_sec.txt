In addition, the results of the U. S. Department of Commerce’ s investigation into the antidumping and countervailing duties circumvention claim on solar cells and panels supplied from Malaysia, Vietnam, Thailand, and Cambodia are uncertain.In addition, our battery storage operations also involve risks associated with lithium-ion batteries.Cyber-attacks and data security breaches could harm our business.Our business relies on electronic systems and network technologies to operate our generation, transmission and distribution infrastructure.There can be no assurance that the outcomes of such matters will not have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position.If the investigation results in additional taxes, tariffs, duties, or other assessments on renewable energy or the equipment necessary to generate or deliver it, such as antidumping and countervailing duty rates, such developments could impede the realization of our U. S. renewables strategy by resulting in, among other items, lack of a satisfactory market for the development and/or financing of our U. S. renewable energy projects, abandoning the development of certain U. S. renewable energy projects, a loss of our investments in the projects, and/or reduced project returns.These wind resource estimates are not expected to reflect actual wind energy production in any given year, but long-term averages of a resource.We also use various financial, accounting, and other infrastructure systems.Wind, solar, and energy storage projects are subject to substantial risks.For additional information regarding our business, see Item 1.—Business of our 2021 Form 10-K. We have two lines of business: generation and utilities.
