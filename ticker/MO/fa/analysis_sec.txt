▪ Final Tobacco Marketing Rule: As required by the FSPTCA, in March 2010, the FDA promulgated a wide range of advertising and promotion restrictions for cigarettes and smokeless tobacco (1) products (the“ Final Tobacco Marketing Rule”).The FDA pre-market authorization enforcement policy varies based on product type and date of availability in the market, specifically: ▪ Pre-existing Tobacco Products are exempt from the pre-market authorization requirement; ▪ cigarette and smokeless tobacco products that were modified or first introduced into the market between February 15, 2007 and March 22, 2011 are generally considered“ Provisional Products” for which SE reports were required to be filed by March 22, 2011.Three Months Ended March 31, 2023 Compared with the Three Months Ended March 31, 2022 Our smokeable products segment’ s reported domestic cigarettes shipment volume decreased 11.4%, driven primarily by the industry’ s decline rate, retail share losses (both of which were impacted by macroeconomic pressures on adult tobacco consumers’ disposable income) and trade inventory movements, partially offset by calendar differences.However, Marlboro’ s share of the premium segment grew to 58.5%, an increase of 0.7 share points versus the prior year and 0.1 share point sequentially.share of the nicotine pouch category grew to 24.6%, an increase of 3.3 share points versus the prior year.In addition: ▪ Effective April 25, 2023, USSTC increased the list price on its Copenhagen popular price products, Red Seal and Husky brands by $0.09 per can.The estimated amounts due under the State Settlement Agreements charged to cost of sales in each year are generally paid in April of the following year.In this Management’ s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (“ MD & A”) section, we refer to the following“ adjusted” financial measures: adjusted operating companies income (loss) (“ OCI”); adjusted OCI margins; adjusted net earnings; adjusted diluted earnings per share; and adjusted effective tax rates.We will continue to monitor conditions related to (i) the economy, including the impact of high inflation, rising interest rates and global supply chain disruptions, (ii) adult tobacco consumer dynamics, including disposable income, purchasing patterns and adoption of smoke-free products and (iii) regulatory and legislative developments.Our 2023 full-year adjusted diluted EPS guidance range includes planned investments in support of our Vision, such as (i) continued smoke-free product research, development and regulatory preparation expenses, (ii) enhancement of our digital consumer engagement system and (iii) marketplace activities in support of our smoke-free products.These items may include, for example, loss on early extinguishment of debt, restructuring charges, asset impairment charges, acquisition-related and disposition-related items, equity investment-related special items (including any changes in fair value of our equity investment recorded at fair value and any changes in the fair value of related warrants and preemptive rights), certain income tax items, charges associated with tobacco and health and certain other litigation items, and resolutions of certain non-participating manufacturer (“ NPM”) adjustment disputes under the MSA (such dispute resolutions are referred to as“ NPM Adjustment Items”).37 Table of Contents ▪ Cronos-Related Special Items: We recorded net pre-tax expense consisting of the following: (1) Amounts include our share of special items recorded by Cronos and additional adjustments, if required under the equity method of accounting, related to our investment in Cronos.Risk Factors in this Form 10-Q, include: ▪ pending and threatened litigation and bonding requirements; ▪ restrictions and requirements imposed by the FSPTCA, and restrictions and requirements (and related enforcement actions) that have been, and in the future will be, imposed by the FDA; ▪ actual and proposed excise tax increases, as well as changes in tax structures and tax stamping requirements; ▪ bans and restrictions on tobacco use imposed by governmental entities and private establishments and employers; 38 Table of Contents ▪ other federal, state and local government actions, including: ▪ restrictions on the sale of certain tobacco products, the sale of tobacco products by certain retail establishments, the sale of tobacco products with characterizing flavors and the sale of tobacco products in certain package sizes; ▪ additional restrictions on the advertising and promotion of tobacco products; ▪ other actual and proposed tobacco-related legislation and regulation; and ▪ governmental investigations; ▪ reductions in consumption levels of cigarettes and MST products; ▪ increased efforts by tobacco control advocates and other private sector entities (including retail establishments) to further restrict the availability and use of tobacco products or the ability to communicate with consumers through third-party digital platforms; ▪ changes in adult tobacco consumer purchase behavior, which is influenced by various factors such as macroeconomic conditions (including inflation), excise taxes and price gap relationships, may result in adult tobacco consumers switching to lower-priced tobacco products; ▪ the highly competitive nature of all tobacco categories, including competitive disadvantages related to cigarette price increases attributable to the settlement of certain litigation and the proliferation of innovative tobacco products, such as e-vapor and oral nicotine pouch products; ▪ illicit trade in tobacco products; and ▪ potential adverse changes in prices, availability and quality of tobacco, other raw materials and component parts, including as a result of changes in macroeconomic and geopolitical conditions.We expect 2023 cigarette industry volume trends to be most influenced by (i) disposable income, purchasing patterns and adoption of smoke-free products, (ii) macroeconomic conditions (including inflation, gasoline prices and unemployment levels), (iii) cross-category movement and (iv) regulatory and legislative (including excise tax) developments.FSPTCA and FDA Regulation ▪ The Regulatory Framework: The FSPTCA and its related regulations establish broad FDA regulatory authority over all tobacco products and, among other provisions: ▪ impose restrictions on the advertising, promotion, sale and distribution of tobacco products (see Final Tobacco Marketing Rule below); ▪ establish pre-market review pathways for new and modified tobacco products (see Pre-Market Review Pathways for Tobacco Products and Market Authorization Enforcement below); ▪ prohibit any express or implied claims that a tobacco product is or may be less harmful than other tobacco products without FDA authorization; ▪ authorize the FDA to impose tobacco product standards that are appropriate for the protection of the public health (see Potential Product Standards below); and ▪ equip the FDA with a variety of investigatory and enforcement tools, including the authority to inspect product manufacturing and other facilities (see Investigation and Enforcement below).▪ FDA Regulatory Actions ▪ Graphic Warnings: In March 2020, the FDA issued a final rule requiring 11 textual warnings accompanied by color graphics depicting certain negative health consequences of smoking on cigarette packaging and advertising.For example, actions by the FDA could: ▪ impact the consumer acceptability of tobacco products; ▪ delay, discontinue or prevent the sale or distribution of existing, new or modified tobacco products; ▪ limit adult tobacco consumer choices; ▪ impose restrictions on communications with adult tobacco consumers; ▪ create a competitive advantage or disadvantage for certain tobacco companies; ▪ impose additional manufacturing, labeling or packaging requirements; ▪ impose additional restrictions at retail; ▪ result in increased illicit trade in tobacco products; and ▪ otherwise significantly increase the cost of doing business.48 Table of ContentsOperating ResultsSmokeable Products SegmentFinancial ResultsThe following table summarizes operating results, includes reported and adjusted OCI margins and provides a reconciliation of reported OCI to adjusted OCI for our smokeable products segment: (1) Reported and adjusted OCI margins are calculated as reported and adjusted OCI, respectively, divided by revenues net of excise taxes.Shipment Volume and Retail Share ResultsThe following table summarizes our smokeable products segment’ s shipment volume performance: Note: Cigarettes shipment volume includes Marlboro;
