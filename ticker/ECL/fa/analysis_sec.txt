Geopolitical tensions or conflicts, such as Russia’ s invasion of Ukraine, may further heighten the risk of cybersecurity attacks.We depend on key personnel to lead our business; the labor market is very dynamic.If it is later determined that the anticipated future cash flows from the acquired business may be less than the carrying values of the assets and goodwill of the acquired business, the assets or goodwill may be deemed to be impaired.Such risks include, but are not limited to, adverse effects on macroeconomic conditions, including increased inflation, constraints on the availability of commodities, supply chain disruption and decreased business spending; disruptions to our or our business partners’ global technology infrastructure, including through cyber-attack or cyber-intrusion; adverse changes in international trade policies and relations; claims, litigation and regulatory enforcement; our ability to implement and execute our business strategy; terrorist activities; our exposure to foreign currency fluctuations; reputational risk; and constraints, volatility, or disruption in the capital markets.If the underlying business performance of such acquired businesses deteriorates, the expected synergies from such transactions do not materialize or we fail to successfully integrate new businesses into our existing businesses, our consolidated results of operations, financial position or cash flows could be materially and adversely affected.The occurrence of (a) litigation or claims, (b) the loss or insolvency of a major customer or distributor, (c) repeated or prolonged federal government shutdowns or similar events, (d) war (including acts of terrorism or hostilities which impact our markets), (e) natural or manmade disasters, (f) water shortages or (g) severe weather conditions affecting our operations or the energy, foodservice, hospitality and travel industries may have a material adverse effect on our business.Our results depend upon the continued vitality of the markets we serve.The conflict in Ukraine may escalate and/or expand in scope and the broader consequences of this conflict, which have included and/or may in the future include sanctions, embargoes, regional instability and geopolitical shifts; potential retaliatory action by the Russian government against companies, including us, such as nationalization of foreign businesses in Russia; and increased tensions between the United States and countries in which we operate cannot be predicted, nor can we predict the conflict’ s impact on the global economy and on our business and financial results.The degree to which the pandemic ultimately impacts our business, financial condition and results of operations and the global economy will depend on future developments beyond our control, which are highly uncertain and difficult to predict, including the severity, duration and any resurgence of the pandemic, the extent, duration and effectiveness of periodic lockdowns and other containment actions, the availability, public adoption and efficacy of COVID vaccines, how quickly and to what extent normal economic and operating activity can resume, and the severity and duration of resulting global economic volatility.Furthermore, increasing public and governmental awareness and concern regarding the effects of climate change has led to significant legislative and regulatory efforts to limit greenhouse gas emissions and will likely result in further environmental and climate change laws and regulations.The potential cost to us relating to environmental and product registration laws and regulations is uncertain due to factors such as the unknown magnitude and type of possible contamination and clean-up costs, the complexity and evolving nature of laws and regulations, and the timing and expense of compliance.Hurricanes or other severe weather events impacting the Gulf Coast, such as the winter freeze in Texas and the Gulf Coast in February 2021, can materially and adversely affect our ability to obtain raw materials at reasonable cost, or at all, and could adversely affect our business with our customers in the region.We are subject to income and other taxes in the United States and foreign jurisdictions, and our operations, plans and results are affected by tax and other initiatives around the world.Some of the BEPS and related proposals, if enacted into law in the United States and in the foreign countries where we do business, could increase the burden and costs of our tax compliance, the amount of taxes we incur in those jurisdictions and our global effective tax rate.Our significant accounting policies are disclosed in Note 2 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements (“ Notes”).Refer to Note 17 for further discussion concerning our accounting policies, estimates, funded status, contributions and overall financial positions of our pension and postretirement plan obligations.Operating Income Fixed currency operating income and fixed currency operating income margins for Global Industrial decreased in 2022 and 2021 when compared to prior periods.Market RiskWe enter into contractual arrangements (derivatives) in the ordinary course of business to manage foreign currency exposure and interest rate risks.Fixed currency sales decreased 5% in 2021 as accelerating pricing was more than offset by volume declines versus the very strong 2020 driven by extraordinary COVID-19 demand last year.Acquisition adjusted fixed currency operating income margins increased in 2021, as the positive impacts from higher volume and increased pricing more than offset the negative impact of the comparison to lower variable compensation last year.Cash dividends declared per share of common stock, by quarter, for each of the last three years were as follows: 46 Table of ContentsLiquidity and Capital ResourcesWe currently expect to fund all of our cash requirements which are reasonably foreseeable for the next twelve months, including scheduled debt repayments, new investments in the business, share repurchases, dividend payments, possible business acquisitions and pension and postretirement contributions with cash from operating activities, and as needed, additional short-term and/or long-term borrowings.The decreased SG & A ratio (SG & A expenses as a percentage of reported net sales) comparing 2021 against 2020 was driven primarily by higher net sales, cost savings initiatives and reduction in bad debt, partially offset by higher variable compensation compared to last year.Our reported operating income decreased 2% when comparing 2022 to 2021 primarily driven by accelerating pricing covering substantially higher delivered product costs, which was offset by investments in the business.Fixed currency sales decreased 3% in 2021 due to lower demand from COVID and impacts from the Texas freeze and Hurricane Ida.At an operating segment level, Healthcare fixed currency sales decreased 1% in 2022 due primarily to lower procedural and hand hygiene volumes, partially offset by increased pricing.Operating IncomeFixed currency operating income for our Global Healthcare & Life Sciences segment increased in 2022 and decreased in 2021 when compared to prior periods.
