Market conditions, including commodity prices, may impact the earnings, financial condition and cash flows of our Midstream business.This could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial position and cash flows, and our ability to make cash distributions.Our operations are subject to planned and unplanned downtime, business interruptions, and operational hazards, any of which could adversely impact our ability to operate and could adversely impact our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.Our operating results are largely dependent on the continued operation of facilities and assets owned and operated by us and our equity affiliates.Any of these or other competitive forces could materially adversely affect our results of operations, financial position or cash flows, as well as our return on capital employed.These developments could potentially have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.Failure to comply could result in significant penalties that may materially adversely affect our business, reputation, results of operations, and cash flows.The level of returns on pension and postretirement plan assets and the actuarial assumptions used for valuation purposes could affect our earnings and cash flows in future periods.For example, in 2017, the California state legislature adopted Assembly Bill 398, which provides direction and parameters on utilizing cap and trade after 2020 to meet the 40% reduction target for GHG emissions from 1990 levels by 2030 specified in Senate Bill 32.A period of sustained low demand or prices for crude oil could lead to a decline in drilling activity and production, which would lead to a decrease in the volumes of crude oil transported through our pipelines and terminal facilities, negatively affecting our earnings and cash flows.Likewise, our earnings and cash flows would be negatively impacted by a period of sustained lower demand for refined petroleum products, which could lead to lower refinery utilization and result in a decrease in the volumes of refined petroleum product transported through our pipelines and terminal facilities.A prolonged disruption of the ability of a pipeline or vessel to transport crude oil, NGL or refined petroleum products to or from one or more of our refineries or other facilities could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.As we cannot predict the duration or scope of any public health crisis, epidemic or pandemic, the negative financial impact to our results cannot be reasonably estimated and could be material.If any of these events had previously occurred or occurs in the future in connection with any of our refineries, pipelines or refined petroleum products terminals, or in connection with any facilities that receive our wastes or byproducts for treatment or disposal, other than events for which we are indemnified, we could be liable for all costs and penalties associated with their remediation under federal, state, local and international environmental laws or common law, and could be liable for property damage to third parties caused by contamination from releases and spills.These include actions to develop international, federal, regional or statewide programs, which could require reductions in our GHG or other emissions, establish a carbon tax and decrease the demand for our refined products.While we will evaluate and defend against any lawsuits vigorously, an unfavorable resolution of any such lawsuit could delay or prevent the consummation of this transaction and the costs of the defense of such lawsuits and other effects of such lawsuits could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.Uninsured or underinsured liabilities arising from operating hazards, including but not limited to, explosions, fires, refinery or pipeline releases or other incidents involving our assets or operations, including weather events, could reduce the funds available to us for capital and investment spending and could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.If a rating agency were to downgrade our rating below investment grade, our borrowing costs would increase, and our funding sources could decrease.Although the easement is vacated, the USACE has no plans to stop pipeline operations while it proceeds with the EIS, and the Tribe’ s request for a shutdown was denied in May 2021.The merger resulted in the acquisition of all limited partnership interests in Phillips 66 Partners not already owned by us in exchange for 41.8 million shares of Phillips 66 common stock issued from treasury stock.We are required to purchase RINs in the open market to satisfy the portion of our obligation under the RFS that is not fulfilled by blending renewable fuels into the motor fuels we produce.For the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020, we incurred expenses of $478 million, $441 million and $342 million, respectively, associated with our obligation to purchase RINs in the open market to comply with the RFS for our wholly owned refineries.Our jointly owned refineries also incurred expenses associated with the purchase of RINs in the open market, of which our share was $437 million, $351 million and $133 million for the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively.68 Table of ContentsIndex to Financial StatementsFor the majority of Superfund sites, our potential liability will be less than the total site remediation costs because the percentage of waste attributable to us, versus that attributable to all other potentially responsible parties, is relatively low.There are relatively few sites where we are a major participant, and given the timing and amounts of anticipated expenditures, neither the cost of remediation at those sites nor such costs at all CERCLA sites, in the aggregate, is expected to have a material adverse effect on our competitive or financial condition.Capitalized environmental costs were $88 million in 2022 and are expected to be approximately $140 million and $250 million, in 2023 and 2024, respectively.The realized refining margins are adjusted to include our proportional share of our joint venture refineries’ realized margins, as well as to exclude those items that are not representative of the underlying operating performance of a period, which we call“ special items.”* * Includes 100% of DCP Midstream Class A Segment’ s volumes from August 18, 2022, forward.* Based on index prices from the Mont Belvieu market hub, which are
