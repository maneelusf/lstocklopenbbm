Global combined sales of Isentress/Isentress HD, an HIV integrase inhibitor for use in combination with other antiretroviral agents for the treatment of HIV-1 infection, declined 24% in both the second quarter and first six months of 2022 due to lower global demand, reflecting in part competitive pressure in Europe and the U. S. The Company expects competitive pressure for Isentress/Isentress HD to continue.As a result of the mandatory change in R & D capitalization rules that are effective for tax years beginning after December 31, 2021 (related to the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017), the Company expects taxes paid in the U. S. to increase significantly for the full year of 2022.The change was primarily due to the cash distribution in 2021 received from Organon in connection with the spin-off (see Note 2 to the condensed consolidated financial statements) coupled with net repayments of short-term borrowings in the prior year period.Recently Issued Accounting StandardsFor a discussion of recently issued accounting standards, see Note 1 to the condensed consolidated financial statements.SKB-264 is currently being evaluated in Phase 2 trials for non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) and advanced solid tumors.The established brands included in the transaction consisted of dermatology, non-opioid pain management, respiratory, select cardiovascular products, as well as the rest of Merck’ s diversified brands franchise.In April 2021, Merck announced it was discontinuing the development of MK-7110 for the treatment of hospitalized patients with COVID-19, which was obtained as part of Merck’ s acquisition of OncoImmune (see Note 3 to the condensed consolidated financial statements).Keytruda is also approved for certain patients with high-risk early-stage TNBC in combination with chemotherapy as neoadjuvant treatment, and then continued as a single agent as adjuvant treatment after surgery.Keytruda sales growth in international markets reflects continued uptake predominately for the NSCLC, HNSCC and RCC indications, particularly in Europe.Verquvo was approved in the U.
