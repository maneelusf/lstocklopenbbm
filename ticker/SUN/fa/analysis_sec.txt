Our inability to renew leases or otherwise maintain the right to utilize such facilities and 16 equipment on acceptable terms, or the increased costs to maintain such rights, could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.The IRA 2022 imposes a methane emissions charge on sources required to report their GHG emissions to the EPA, which would start in calendar year 2024 at $900 per ton of methane, increase to $1,200 in 2025, and be set at $1,500 for 2026 and each year after.In December 2022, the EPA released a proposed rule under the RFS for renewable fuel volumes for the years 2023-2025 that further increases targets for the production of renewable fuels.In addition, our General Partner is allowed to take into account the interests of parties other than us or our unitholders, such as Energy Transfer, in resolving conflicts of interest.Our partnership agreement also contains provisions limiting the ability of unitholders to call meetings or to acquire information about our operations, as well as other provisions limiting our unitholders’ ability to influence the manner or direction of management.If our unitholders are dissatisfied with the performance of our General Partner, they have limited ability to remove our General Partner.Our General Partner interest or the control of our General Partner may be transferred to a third party without unitholder consent.Our General Partner may transfer its General Partner interest to a third party without the consent of our unitholders in a merger, in a sale of all or substantially all of its assets or in other transactions so long as certain conditions are satisfied.Our General Partner has a limited call right that may require unitholders to sell their common units at an undesirable time or price.We may issue additional units without unitholder approval, which would dilute existing unitholder ownership interests.Our partnership agreement restricts unitholders’ voting rights by providing that any units held by a person or group that owns 20% or more of any class of units then outstanding, other than our General Partner and its affiliates, their transferees and persons who acquired such units with the prior approval of the board of directors of our General Partner, cannot vote on any matter.It also could affect the amount of gain from our unitholders’ sale of common units and could have a negative impact on the value of the common units or result in audit adjustments to our unitholders’ tax returns without the benefit of additional deductions.For 2022 and 2021, proceeds of disposal from property and equipment were $32 million and $34 million, respectively.Capital expenditures were $186 million and $174 million for 2022 and 2021, respectively.Proceeds from disposal of property and equipment were $32 million and $34 million in 2022 and 2021, respectively.However, an increase in cost of capital as a result of Federal Reserve policy to combat inflationary pressures has impacted financing costs and could impact our ability to expand.To the extent our underlying assumptions about or interpretation of available information prove to be incorrect, our actual results may vary materially from our expected results.To the extent that results of operations are significantly impacted by discrete items or activities within the All Other segment, such impacts are specifically attributed to the All Other segment in the discussion and analysis below.As a normal part of our business, depending on market conditions, we will from time to time consider opportunities to repay, redeem, repurchase or refinance our indebtedness.Changes in our operating plans, lower than anticipated sales, increased expenses, acquisitions or other events may cause us to seek additional debt or equity financing in future periods.Cash FlowsOur cash flows may change in the future due to a number of factors, some of which we cannot control.Critical accounting policies are those we believe are both most important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results of operations, and require our most difficult, subjective or complex judgments, often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effects of matters that are inherently uncertain.Judgments and uncertainties affecting the application of those policies may result in materially different amounts being reported under different conditions or using different assumptions.As such, these estimates may require adjustments in the future as additional facts become known or as circumstances change.
