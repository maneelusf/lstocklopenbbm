(“ Immunomedics”) in 2020.Our global operations are accompanied by certain financial, political, economic and other risks, including those listed below: • Foreign Currency Exchange: For the three months ended March 31, 2023, approximately 30% of our product sales were outside the U. S. Because a significant percentage of our product sales is denominated in foreign currencies, primarily the Euro, we face exposure to adverse movements in foreign currency exchange rates.It is not possible to predict or identify all such factors; our operations could also be affected by factors, events or uncertainties that are not presently known to us or that we currently do not consider to present significant risks to our operations.Cell TherapyAdvancing a novel and personalized therapy such as Yescarta or Tecartus, which are chimeric antigen receptor (“ CAR”) T-cell therapies, creates significant challenges, including: • educating and certifying medical personnel regarding the procedures and the potential side effects, such as cytokine release syndrome and neurologic toxicities, in compliance with the Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy program required by FDA; • securing sufficient supply of other medications to manage side effects, such as tocilizumab and corticosteroids, which may not be available in sufficient quantities, may not adequately control the side effects and/or may have detrimental impacts on the efficacy of cell therapy; • developing and maintaining a robust and reliable process for engineering a patient’ s T cells in our facilities and infusing them back into the patient; and 33 • conditioning patients with chemotherapy in advance of administering our therapy, which may increase the risk of adverse side effects.We rely on third-party sites to collect patients’ white blood cells, known as apheresis centers, as well as shippers, couriers, and hospitals for the logistical collection of patients’ white blood cells and ultimate delivery of Yescarta and Tecartus to patients.35 • U. S. Congress has enacted the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 (the“ Act”), which, among other changes, (1) requires the Department of Health and Human Services to“ negotiate” Medicare prices for certain drugs (starting with 10 drugs in 2026, adding 15 drugs in 2027 and 2028, and adding 20 drugs in 2029 and subsequent years), (2) imposes an inflation-based rebate on Medicare Part B utilization starting in 2023 and Part D utilization beginning October 1, 2022, and (3) restructures the Medicare Part D benefit to cap out-of-pocket expenses for Part D beneficiaries beginning in 2024 and, effective January 1, 2025, increases Part D plans’ contributions in the catastrophic coverage phase and increases manufacturers’ discount contributions across coverage phases such that manufacturers must pay a 10% discount in the initial coverage phase and a 20% discount in the catastrophic phase on drugs utilized by all Part D beneficiaries, including low income subsidy patients.We may be adversely affected if any generic versions of our products, whether or not produced and/or distributed under these agreements, are exported to the U. S., the EU or markets with higher prices.Based on trial results, it is possible that FDA and other regulatory authorities do not approve our product candidates, or that any market approvals include significant limitations on the products’ use.We may not be able to obtain materials or supplies necessary to conduct clinical trials or to manufacture and sell our products, which could limit our ability to generate revenues.Our success depends to a significant degree on our ability to: • obtain patents and licenses to patent rights; • preserve trade secrets and internal know-how; • defend against infringement of our patents and efforts to invalidate them; and • operate without infringing on the intellectual property of others.Patents covering our existing compounds, products and processes, and those that we will likely file in the future, may not provide complete or adequate protection.We may be adversely impacted if the U. S. dollar appreciates significantly against certain currencies and our hedging program does not sufficiently offset the effects of such appreciation.If our ESG practices do not meet evolving investor or other stakeholder expectations and standards, then our reputation, our ability to attract or retain employees and our attractiveness as an investment, business partner or acquiror could be negatively impacted.We may not identify suitable transactions in the future and, if we do, we may not complete such transactions in a timely manner, on a cost-effective basis, or at all, including the possibility that a governmental entity or regulatory body may delay or refuse to grant approval for the consummation of the transaction.For example, as a result of an impairment analysis we conducted following our receipt of data in March 2022 from the Phase 3 TROPiCS-02 study evaluating Trodelvy in patients with hormone receptor-positive, human epidermal growth receptor 2-negative metastatic breast cancer, we recognized a partial in-process research and development impairment charge on our Condensed Consolidated Statements of Income during 2022.Key Financial Results NM-Not MeaningfulTotal revenues decreased by 4% to $6.4 billion for the three months ended March 31, 2023, compared to the same period in 2022, primarily due to lower sales of Veklury, partially offset by higher product sales in HIV, Cell Therapy and Trodelvy.VekluryVeklury product sales decreased by 63% to $573 million for the three months ended March 31, 2023, compared to the same period in 2022, primarily due to lower demand driven by reduced hospitalization rates in all regions.OtherOther product sales decreased by 16% to $199 million for the three months ended March 31, 2023, compared to the same period in 2022, primarily due to lower demand for AmBisome and Letairis.Interest Expense and Other Income (Expense), NetThe following table summarizes the period-over-period changes in Interest expense and Other income (expense), net: Interest expense for the three months ended March 31, 2023 decreased by 4% to $230 million, compared to the same period in 2022, primarily due to lower outstanding debt balances.Management OverviewGilead Sciences, Inc. (“ Gilead,”“ we,”“ our” or“ us”) is a biopharmaceutical company that has pursued and achieved breakthroughs in medicine for more than three decades, with the goal of creating a healthier world for all people.Of our total product sales, 30% and 34% were generated outside the U.
