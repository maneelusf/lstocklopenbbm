Tax and trade policies, tariffs, and other regulations affecting trade between the United States and other countries, especially China, enacted in recent years increased the cost of our merchandise sourced from outside of the United States, which represents a large percentage of our overall merchandise.Cyber attacks and tactics designed to gain access to and exploit sensitive information by breaching mission critical systems of large organizations are constantly evolving, and high profile security breaches leading to unauthorized release of sensitive customer information have occurred in recent years with increasing frequency at a number of major U. S. companies, including several large retailers, despite widespread recognition of the cyber-attack threat and improved data protection methods.Natural disasters, such as hurricanes and tropical storms, fires, floods, tornadoes, and earthquakes; unseasonable, or unexpected or extreme weather conditions, such as major or extended winter storms or droughts, whether as a result of climate change or otherwise; severe changes in climate; pandemics and public health concerns; acts of terrorism or violence, including active shooter situations; civil unrest; or similar disruptions and catastrophic events can affect consumer spending and confidence and consumers’ disposable income, particularly with respect to home improvement or construction projects, and could have an adverse effect on our financial performance.You should read these risk factors in conjunction with“ Management’ s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” in Item 7 and our consolidated financial statements and related notes in Item 8.The significant expansion in the use of social media over recent years has compounded the potential scope of the negative publicity that could be generated by such negative incidents.The inflation or deflation of commodity and other prices could affect our prices, demand for our products and our sales.We source a large number of our products from foreign manufacturers, with China being the dominant import source.The home improvement retail environment, like the retail environment generally, is rapidly evolving, and adapting our business concept to respond to our customers’ changing shopping habits and demands and their changing demographics is critical to our future success.The success of our strategic initiatives to adapt our business concept to our customers’ changing shopping habits and demands and changing demographics have required us to, and will continue to require us to, deliver large, complex programs requiring integrated planning, initiative prioritization, and program sequencing.Our public image and reputation are critical to ensuring that our customers shop at Lowe’ s, our vendors want to do business with Lowe’ s, and our associates want to work for Lowe’ s.For example, in fiscal 2022, the Company recorded pre-tax impairment, loss on sale, and other closing costs of $2.5 billion related to the sale of its Canadian retail business, which reduced earnings for fiscal 2022.Net earnings for fiscal 2022 decreased 23.8% to $6.4 billion.6 Return on invested capital is calculated using a non-GAAP financial measure.Table of ContentsReturn on Invested CapitalReturn on Invested Capital (ROIC) is calculated using a non-GAAP financial measure.Net Sales–Net sales increased 0.8% to $97.1 billion in 2022.Inventory decreased operating cash flow for fiscal 2022 by approximately $2.6 billion compared to a decrease of $1.4 billion for fiscal 2021.In this model, product flows directly to customer homes from our distribution network, bypassing stores altogether.We believe these sources of liquidity will continue to support our business for the next twelve months.Operating locations which are sold are included in comparable sales until the date of sale.The Company’ s methods of determining this non-GAAP financial measure may differ from the method used by other companies and may not be comparable.We base these estimates on historical results and various other assumptions believed to be reasonable, all of which form the basis for making estimates concerning the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily available from other sources.Judgments and uncertainties involved in the estimateWe do not believe that our merchandise inventories are subject to significant risk of obsolescence in the near term, and we have the ability to adjust purchasing practices based on anticipated sales trends and general economic conditions.If actual results are not consistent with the assumptions and estimates used, we could be exposed to additional adjustments that could positively or negatively impact gross margin and inventory.Self-insurance claims filed and claims incurred but not reported are accrued based upon our estimates of the discounted ultimate cost for self-insured claims incurred using actuarial assumptions followed in the insurance industry and historical experience.
