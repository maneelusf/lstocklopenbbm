At December 31, 2019, we had state NOL carryforwards of approximately $18 billion.Additionally, at December 31, 2019, we had foreign NOL carryforwards of $6 billion.More recently, continuous improvements in wireless data technologies have enabled wireless carriers to offer competing data transmission products that are highly convenient to use, and we expect this trend to continue as technological advances enable these carriers to carry greater amounts of data faster and with less latency.As a result, we expect to utilize only a small portion of the state NOL carryforwards, and consequently have determined that as of December 31, 2019, these state NOL carryforwards, net of federal benefit, had a net tax benefit (after giving effect to our valuation allowance) of $372 million.Although we maintain property and casualty insurance on our property (excluding our above ground outside plant) and may, under certain circumstances, be able to seek recovery of some additional costs through increased rates, only a portion of our additional costs directly related to such natural disasters have historically been recoverable.The trading price of our common stock could be reduced if a large number of shares of our common stock are sold in the public market, or under various other circumstances.While we believe we have largely mitigated the issues identified by our 2017 investigation, we cannot assure you that all of our service support issues have been addressed to the full satisfaction of our customers.Various events in recent years have placed pressures on the stability of the currencies of several Latin American countries in which we operate, including Argentina, Brazil and Colombia.For more information, see "Business—Regulation" in Item 1 of this report, and "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations" in Item 7 of this report.Under our January 31, 2020 amended and restated credit agreement, a“ change of control” of CenturyLink, Inc. constitutes an event of default.We maintain (i) disclosure controls and procedures designed to provide reasonable assurances regarding the accuracy and completeness of our SEC reports and (ii) internal control over financial reporting designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability and compliance with GAAP of our financial statements.For additional information, please see our Registration Statement on Form 8-A/A filed with the SEC on March 2, 2015.Our goodwill was derived from numerous acquisitions where the purchase price exceeded the fair value of the net assets acquired.We are required to reassign goodwill to reporting units whenever reorganizations of our internal reporting structure changes the composition of our reporting units.When the fair value of a reporting unit is available, we allocate goodwill based on the relative fair value of the reporting units.Our annual impairment assessment date for goodwill is October 31, at which date we assess our reporting units.For each reporting unit, we compare its estimated fair value of equity to its carrying value of equity that we assign to the reporting unit.As of October 31, 2018, based on our assessment we concluded that the estimated fair value of our consumer reporting unit was less than our carrying value of equity for such unit by approximately $2.7 billion.The increase in amortization expense was primarily attributable to the inclusion of $659 million, of post-acquisition Legacy Level 3 amortization expense in our consolidated amortization expense.Though the validity of any tax position is a matter of tax law, the body of statutory, regulatory and interpretive guidance on the application of the law is complex and often ambiguous, particularly in certain of the non-U.
