• Reduced profitability to the extent that lower revenues, increased bad debt, and higher interest expense are not recovered through rates; • Higher rates charged to our customers, which could impact our competitive position; • Reduced demand for energy, which could impact revenues and operating expenses; and • Shutting down of generation facilities if the cost of generation exceeds the market price for electricity.Consolidated EarningsThe following table compares our consolidated results for the year ended December 31, 2022 with the year ended December 31, 2021, including favorable or better, "B," and unfavorable or worse, "W," variances: Earnings increased $107.8 million during 2022, compared with 2021.For a similar discussion that compares our results for the year ended December 31, 2021 with the year ended December 31, 2020, see Item 7.Table of ContentsWisconsin Segment Contribution to Net Income Attributed to Common ShareholdersThe Wisconsin segment's contribution to net income attributed to common shareholders for the year ended December 31, 2022 was $758.4 million, representing a $51.9 million, or 7.3%, increase over the prior year.Illinois Segment Contribution to Net Income Attributed to Common ShareholdersThe Illinois segment's contribution to net income attributed to common shareholders for the year ended December 31, 2022 was $226.9 million, representing a $3.9 million, or 1.7%, increase over the prior year.Other States Segment Contribution to Net Income Attributed to Common ShareholdersThe other states segment's contribution to net income attributed to common shareholders for the year ended December 31, 2022 was $39.7 million, representing a $3.9 million, or 10.9%, increase over the prior year.For a similar discussion that compares our cash flows for the year ended December 31, 2021 with the year ended December 31, 2020, see Item 7.The results of this testing continue to be analyzed and will be shared more broadly when complete.In addition, we anticipate that credits generated in 2023 and beyond will be eligible to be transferred to third parties in exchange for cash.As a result, WE and WPS defer as a regulatory asset or liability, the difference between actual transmission costs and those included in rates until recovery or refund is authorized in a future rate proceeding.WE has partnered with an unaffiliated utility to construct a solar project, Badger Hollow II, that will be located in Iowa County, Wisconsin.These facilities are expected to reduce the likelihood of constraints on WE's and WG's natural gas systems during the highest demand days of winter.In addition to our energy-related purchase obligations, we have commitments for other costs incurred in the normal course of business, including costs related to information technology services, meter reading services, maintenance and other service agreements for certain generating facilities, and various engineering agreements.Investments in Outside TrustsWe maintain investments in outside trusts to fund the obligation to provide pension and certain OPEB benefits to current and future retirees.From time to time, we may enter into commodity contracts that could require collateral or a termination payment in the event of a credit rating change to below BBB-at S & P Global Ratings, a division of S & P Global Inc., and/or Baa 3 at Moody’ s Investors Service, Inc.In addition, we believe it would be impractical to construct competing duplicate distribution facilities due to the high cost of installation.However, natural gas utilities have customarily avoided competing for existing customers of other utilities, as there would be duplicative utility facilities and/or increased costs to customers.Regulators can impose liabilities on a prospective basis for amounts previously collected from customers and for amounts that are expected to be refunded to customers.Funding in the Act should also help to expand emerging technologies, like hydrogen and carbon management, as we continue the transition to a clean energy future.In addition, WE, WPS, and UMERC would be entitled to receive a portion of the refund from ATC for the benefit of their customers.In addition, any economic downturn or disruption of national or international markets could adversely affect the financial condition of our customers and demand for their products, which could affect their demand for our products.Risk Factors–Risks Related to the Operation of Our Business–Our operations and corporate strategy may be adversely affected by supply chain disruptions and inflation.Certain items that would otherwise be immediately recognized as revenues and expenses are deferred as regulatory assets and regulatory liabilities for future recovery or refund to customers, as authorized by our regulators.
