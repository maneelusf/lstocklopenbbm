18 See Note 7 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8, "Financial Statements and Supplementary Data," of this Form 10-K for disclosures on our debt and credit facilities.Our comparable sales, including the associated comparable online sales, have fluctuated significantly in the past on an annual and quarterly basis.Since the beginning of fiscal 2020, in connection with our Power Plan strategy, we have closed hundreds of Gap and Banana Republic stores in North America.Our business is subject to risks associated with global sourcing and manufacturing.In many of these locations, we face major established competitors.As of January 28, 2023, the aggregate principal amount of our total outstanding indebtedness was $1.5 billion under the Senior Notes and $350 million of borrowings under the ABL Facility.The global regulatory environment surrounding information security, cybersecurity, and data privacy is increasingly demanding, and we are required to comply with new and constantly evolving laws, such as the European Union’ s General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), the California Consumer Privacy Act, the California Privacy Rights Act and the Virginia Consumer Data Protection Act, each of which gives customers the right to control how their personal information is collected, used and retained.As of January 28, 2023, we had $1.85 billion in principal amount of undrawn commitments available for additional borrowings under the ABL Facility, subject to borrowing base availability.We generated net cash from operating activities of $607 million in fiscal 2022 and ended fiscal 2022 with $1,215 million of cash and cash equivalents on our balance sheet.These arrangements could have an adverse effect on our liquidity and results of operations.An unfavorable outcome could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.On March 1, 2023, the third party that operates our Gap France franchise business was placed into receivership.28 Net Sales DiscussionOur net sales for fiscal 2022 decreased $1.1 billion, or 6 percent, compared with fiscal 2021, driven primarily by Old Navy Global as a result of inventory delays related to global supply chain disruptions, as well as size and assortment imbalances in the first half of fiscal 2022.25 We remain focused on the following strategic priorities in the near term: • managing inventory to support a healthy merchandise margin; • reducing and optimizing our fixed cost structure to improve profitability and manage through current macroeconomic challenges; • driving sales through assortment improvements and a balanced and relevant category mix; • driving creative excellence and delivering product that offers value to our customers through a combination of fit, quality, brand, and price; • rationalizing the Gap and Banana Republic store fleet; • prioritizing asset-light growth through licensing, online, and franchise partnerships globally; • optimizing investments in our four purpose-led lifestyle brands to drive relevance and market share; • attracting and retaining strong talent in our businesses and functions; and • continuing to integrate social and environmental sustainability into business practices to support long-term growth.• Gross profit for fiscal 2022 was $5.4 billion compared with $6.6 billion for fiscal 2021.Gross margin for fiscal 2022 was 34.3 percent compared with 39.8 percent for fiscal 2021.We plan to pay a dividend of $0.15 per share in the first quarter of fiscal 2023.On January 31, 2023, the Gap China transaction closed with Baozun.Cost of goods sold and occupancy expenses decreased 5.7 percentage points as a percentage of net sales in fiscal 2021 compared with fiscal 2020.Overview Financial results for fiscal 2022 are as follows: • Net sales for fiscal 2022 decreased 6 percent to $15.6 billion compared with $16.7 billion for fiscal 2021.The increase was also due to inventory impairment which was primarily related to seasonal product and extended size product at Old Navy Global as well as the decision to discontinue the Yeezy Gap business.• Occupancy expenses decreased 2.6 percentage points as a percentage of net sales in fiscal 2021 compared with fiscal 2020, primarily driven by an increase in net sales largely due to temporary store closures as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic during fiscal 2020 as well as a decrease in fixed occupancy expenses due to strategic store closures.Operating expenses increased $260 million, but decreased 5.3 percentage points as a percentage of net sales in fiscal 2021 compared with fiscal 2020 primarily due to an increase in net sales as well as the following: • an increase in advertising expense to support demand generation across all purpose-led lifestyle brands; • an increase in performance-based compensation; • an increase in store payroll and benefits and other store operating expenses due to COVID-19 temporary store closures during fiscal 2020 which was partially offset by additional costs incurred during fiscal 2020 to support health and safety measures as stores reopened; • an increase related to fiscal 2021 strategic initiatives including divestiture activity and the review of our European operating model; and • an increase related to digital innovation costs to fuel the growth priorities of the business; partially offset by • a decrease due to impairment charges of $557 million during fiscal 2020 primarily due to the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic and a strategic review of the Intermix business; and • a decrease in lease termination fees.
