S. generally accepted accounting principles ("GAAP").To fund cash needs in the United States, we rely on ongoing cash flow from U. S. operations, access to capital markets and remittances from foreign subsidiaries of earnings that are not considered to be permanently reinvested.The Warning Letter states that, until BD resolves the outstanding issues covered by the Warning Letter, the FDA will not approve any premarket submissions for Class III devices to which the non-conformances are reasonably related or grant requests for certificates to foreign governments.The FDA review of these remaining commitments is ongoing, and no assurances can be given regarding further action by the FDA as a result of these commitments, including but not limited to action pursuant to the Warning Letter.No assurances can be given as to when or if clearance will be obtained from the FDA.
