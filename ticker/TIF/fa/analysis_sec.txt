(i) The announcement and pendency of the pending Merger may adversely affect the Company's business, financial condition and results of operations.(iii) The COVID-19 outbreak and resulting adverse economic conditions have had a significant effect on the Company's sales results, and are expected to continue to have a significant negative impact on the Company's business.These supply chain effects may negatively affect the Company's ability to meet consumer demand and may increase the Company's costs of production and distribution.Any of the impacts discussed above could have a significant negative impact on the Company's business, sales, cash flows and results of operations.These risks to the Company's business include, among others, the following, all of which may be exacerbated by a delay in the completion of the pending Merger: (i) the impairment of the Company's ability to attract, retain, and motivate its employees; (ii) the diversion of significant management time and attention from ongoing business operations towards the completion of the pending Merger; (iii) difficulties maintaining relationships with customers, suppliers and other business partners; (iv) delays or deferments of certain business decisions by the Company's customers, suppliers and other business partners; (v) the inability to pursue alternative business opportunities or make appropriate changes to the Company's business because the Merger Agreement requires the Company to, subject to certain exceptions, including as required by a Governmental Entity or by applicable Law (in each case as defined in the Merger Agreement), conduct its business in the ordinary course of business and to not engage in certain kinds of transactions prior to the completion of the pending Merger without the prior written consent of Parent (such consent not to be unreasonably conditioned, withheld or delayed), even if such actions could prove beneficial; (vi) litigation relating to the pending Merger and the costs related thereto; and (vii) the incurrence of significant costs, expenses and fees for professional services and other transaction costs in connection with the pending Merger.(ii) Failure to consummate the pending Merger within the expected time frame or at all may have a material adverse impact on the Company's business, financial condition and results of operations.The consummation of the pending Merger is subject to various conditions, including, among others, customary conditions relating to (i) the adoption of the Merger Agreement (as defined in "Item 1.Risk Factors "in the Registrant's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended January 31, 2020 (" Form 10-K Annual Report ") and the Registrant's Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the three months ended July 31, 2020 (" Second Quarter Form 10-Q Quarterly Report "), which could materially affect its business, financial condition and results of operations.Except as presented below, there have been no material changes to the risk factors disclosed in Part I, Item 1A in the Registrant's Form 10-K Annual Report and in Part II, Item 1A in the Registrant's Second Quarter Form 10-Q Quarterly Report.NOVEL CORONAVIRUSAn outbreak of a novel strain of the coronavirus, COVID-19, was identified in China in December 2019 and was subsequently recognized as a pandemic by the World Health Organization in March 2020.Total sales results reflected sales declines across the region, which management attributed to the effects of COVID-19, and the resulting store closures across the region that began in mid-March 2020 and continued into June, with most stores in the region reopened in mid-June.Management attributed the decrease in the third quarter to a decline in foreign tourism in the region, as well as strong growth in the prior year due to high consumer demand prior to the consumption tax increase which occurred on October 1, 2019.Management attributed the decrease in the year-to-date to the effects of COVID-19, including the resulting store closures across the region, which primarily began in early April 2020 and continued through early June, and the decline in tourist traffic beginning early in the first quarter of 2020.In the third quarter, sales decreased across most of the region, which management attributed to a decline in foreign tourism in the region related to the continuing effects of COVID-19.The decrease in the year-to-date was primarily due to (i) sales deleverage on fixed costs resulting from the effects of COVID-19 on net sales, (ii) certain overhead costs not capitalized in the period resulting from certain manufacturing locations being closed or operating at reduced capacity due to COVID-19 and (iii) an increase in inventory reserves, partially offset by a change in sales mix to higher margin products.45 Table of Contentsthird quarter, the increase in SG & A expenses from costs related to the pending Merger was more than offset by decreased marketing spending and continued prudent management of the Company's operating expenses, which included the reduction or elimination of certain non-essential spending.Foundation was more than offset by decreased marketing spending (although (i) marketing expense as a percentage of net sales in the year-to-date of 2020 was approximately in line with the Company's historical percentage and (ii) the Company plans to increase its marketing spending in the fourth quarter of 2020 as compared to the third quarter of 2020), decreased labor and incentive compensation costs and decreased store occupancy expenses.46 Table of ContentsOn a segment basis, the earnings from operations to each segment's net sales in the third quarter of 2020 compared with 2019 was as follows: • Americas–The ratio decreased due to sales deleverage on operating expenses and a decrease in gross margin; • Asia-Pacific–The ratio increased due to sales leverage on operating expenses and an increase in gross margin; • Japan–The ratio increased due to an increase in gross margin and a decrease in the SG & A expense ratio; and • Europe–The ratio increased due to a decrease in the SG & A expense ratio and an increase in gross margin.On a segment basis, the earnings from operations to each segment's net sales in the year-to-date of 2020 compared with 2019 was as follows: • Americas–The ratio decreased due to sales deleverage on operating expenses, which management attributed to the effects of COVID-19 on net sales, as discussed above, and a decrease in gross margin; • Asia-Pacific–The ratio increased due to a decrease in the SG & A expense ratio and an increase in gross margin; • Japan–The ratio decreased due to sales deleverage on operating expenses, which management attributed to the effects of COVID-19 on net sales, as discussed above, and a decrease in gross margin; and • Europe–The ratio decreased due to sales deleverage on operating expenses, which management attributed to the effects of COVID-19 on net sales, as discussed above, and a decrease in gross margin.The decrease in the year-to-date was primarily due to a decrease in incentive compensation expense and continued prudent management of the Company's operating expenses, partly offset by a $12.3 million charge that was recorded to fully reserve the asset related to an expected insurance recovery in respect of the bankruptcy filing of a metal refiner to which the Company entrusted precious scrap metal (see "Item 1.Debt ") during the first quarter of 2020 as a precautionary measure in order to increase its cash position and maintain financial flexibility in light of the uncertainty in the global markets resulting from COVID-19.The decrease compared to both January 31, 2020 and October 31, 2019 included (i) declines in trade payables, (ii) a decrease in incentive compensation accruals and (iii) the recognition of a gain previously deferred related to amounts received as compensation for the previous acquisition of the premises containing one of the Company's leased retail stores and an administrative office in Sydney, Australia under compulsory acquisition laws in that country (see "Item 1.
