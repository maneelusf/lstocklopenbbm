13 We have committed to paying fair wages and providing the benefits that were collectively bargained with the United Food and Commercial Workers (“ UFCW”) and other labor unions representing associates.15 PAYMENT SYSTEMSWe accept payments using a variety of methods, including cash and checks, select credit and debit cards, and Kroger Pay, a mobile payment solution.For example, we are subject to Payment Card Industry Data Security Standards (“ PCI DSS”), which contain compliance guidelines and standards with regard to our security surrounding the physical and electronic storage, processing and transmission of individual cardholder data.We believe our plans to continue to improve these four strategic pillars will enable us to meet the wide-ranging needs and expectations of our customers.We must anticipate and meet these evolving customer preferences and continue to implement technology, software and processes to be able to conveniently and cost-effectively fulfill customer orders.Through our sales and marketing activities, we collect and store some personal information that our customers provide to us.As we offer new payment options to our customers, we may be subject to additional rules, regulations, compliance requirements, and higher fraud losses.We rely on third parties to provide payment transaction processing services for credit and debit cards.We estimate our exposure to these legal proceedings and establish accruals for the estimated liabilities, where it is reasonably possible to estimate and where an adverse outcome is probable.Increased fuel prices also have an effect on consumer spending and on our costs of producing and procuring products that we sell.Further, if we are unable to control health care, pension and wage costs, or if we have insufficient operational flexibility under our collective bargaining agreements, we may experience increased operating costs and an adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.As we modernize legacy systems, if we are unable to successfully implement those systems in a coordinated manner across internal and external stakeholders, we could be subject to business interruption or reputation risk with our customers, suppliers or associates.14 Our cybersecurity program, continued investment in our information technology systems, and our processes to evaluate and select vendors with reasonable information security controls may not effectively insulate us from potential attacks, data breaches or disruptions to our business operations, which could result in a loss of customers or business information, negative publicity, damage to our reputation, and exposure to claims from customers, financial institutions, regulatory authorities, payment card associations, associates and other persons.Following a cyber-attack, our and/or our vendors’ remediation efforts may not be successful, and a cyber-attack could result in interruptions, delays or cessation of service, and loss of existing or potential customers.We are unable to predict future regulations, environmental effects, political unrest, acts of war or terrorism, disruptions to the economy, including but not limited to the COVID-19 pandemic, the war between Russia and Ukraine, and other matters that affect the cost and availability of fuel, and how our customers will react to such factors, which could adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.To the extent that COVID-19 continues to affect the U. S. and global economy and our business, it may also heighten other risks described in this section, including but not limited to those related to consumer behavior and expectations, competition, implementation of strategic initiatives, cybersecurity threats, payment-related risks, supply chain disruptions, labor availability and cost, litigation and operational risk as a result of regulatory requirements.If we are unable to continue to meet these challenges and comply with all laws, regulations, policies and related interpretations, it could negatively affect our reputation and our business results.Our LIFO charge was $626 million in 2022 and $197 million in 2021.In 2022, we recorded a goodwill impairment charge for Vitacost. com totaling $160 million.Our KSP reporting unit has a goodwill balance of $243 million.As of December 31, 2022, we estimate our share of the underfunding of multi-employer pension plans to which we contribute was approximately $2.5 billion, $1.9 billion net of tax.This represents an increase in the estimated amount of underfunding of approximately $1.4 billion, $1.1 billion net of tax, as of December 31, 2022, compared to December 31, 2021.At the end of 2022, we expect certain multi-employer pension plans in which we participate, for which our estimated share of underfunding is approximately $1.0 billion, $750 million net of tax, to apply for funding in 2023, which may reduce a portion of our share of unfunded multi-employer pension plan liabilities.Capital investments for the purchase of leased facilities totaled $21 million in 2022.The shares we repurchased in 2022 were reacquired under the following share repurchase programs: As of January 28, 2023, there was $1.0 billion remaining under the September 2022 Repurchase Program.Factors Affecting LiquidityWe can currently borrow on a daily basis approximately $2.75 billion under our commercial paper program.As of January 28, 2023, we maintained a $2.75 billion (with the ability to increase by $1.25 billion), unsecured revolving credit facility that, unless extended, terminates on July 6, 2026.The outstanding letters of credit that reduce funds available under our credit facility totaled $2 million as of January 28, 2023.The entry into the term loan credit agreement reduced the commitments under our bridge facility commitment letter from $17.4 billion to $12.65 billion.We had $467 million of outstanding surety bonds as of January 28, 2023.We had $310 million of outstanding standby letters of credit as of January 28, 2023.
