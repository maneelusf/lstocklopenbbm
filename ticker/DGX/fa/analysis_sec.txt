As of December 31, 2022, we had approximately $4.0 billion of debt outstanding.We believe that PAMA-driven reimbursement pressure remains a catalyst for structural change in the market.We believe that federal and state governments continue aggressive enforcement efforts against perceived healthcare fraud.The FDA and HHS have expressed views regarding the regulation of LDTs.Our success depends, in part, on the continued and uninterrupted performance of our IT systems.Competitors also may compete on the basis of new service offerings.Such changes also could require us to modify our business objectives.These proceedings also may result in substantial monetary damages.If such ratings are lowered, our borrowing costs could increase.These issues can also arise as a result of failures by third parties with whom we do business and over which we have limited control.In addition, new players have recently started to provide clinical lab testing services (e. g., employers; government agencies).Competitors also may offer testing to be performed outside of a commercial clinical laboratory, such as (1) point-of-care testing that can be performed by physicians in their offices; (2) advanced testing that can be performed by IDNs in their own laboratories; and (3) home testing that can be carried out without requiring the services of outside providers.While we seek to conduct our business in compliance with all applicable laws, many of the laws and regulations applicable to us are vague or indefinite and have not been extensively interpreted by the courts, including many of those relating to: • billing and reimbursement of clinical testing; • certification or licensure of clinical laboratories; • the anti-self-referral and anti-kickback laws and regulations; • the laws and regulations administered by the FDA; • the corporate practice of medicine; • operational, personnel and quality requirements intended to ensure that clinical testing services are accurate, reliable and timely; • physician fee splitting; • relationships with physicians and IDNs; • marketing to consumers; 35 Table of Contents • privacy of patient data and other personal information; • safety and health of laboratory employees; and • handling, transportation and disposal of medical specimens, infectious and hazardous waste and radioactive materials.Regardless of merit or eventual outcome, these types of investigations and related litigation can result in: • diversion of management time and attention; • expenditure of large amounts of cash on legal fees, costs and payment of damages; • increases to our administrative, billing or other operating costs; • limitations on our ability to continue some of our operations; • enforcement actions, fines and penalties or the assertion of private litigation claims and damages; • decreases to the amount of reimbursement related to diagnostic information services performed; • adverse affects to important business relationships with third parties; • decreased demand for our services; and/or • injury to our reputation.Our international operations increase our exposure to risks inherent in doing business in non-U. S. markets, which may vary by market and include: intellectual property legal protections and remedies; weak legal systems which may, among other things, affect our ability to enforce contractual rights; trade regulations and procedures and actions affecting approval, production, pricing, reimbursement and marketing of services; existing and emerging data privacy regulations affecting the processing and transfer of personal data; and challenges based on differing languages and cultures.In addition, we may be subject to intellectual property litigation, and we may be found to infringe on the proprietary rights of others, which could force us to do one or more of the following: • cease developing, performing or selling solutions or services that incorporate the challenged intellectual property; • obtain and pay for licenses from the holder of the infringed intellectual property right; • redesign or re-engineer our tests; • change our business processes; or • pay substantial damages, court costs and attorneys'fees, including potentially increased damages for any infringement held to be willful.Competitors also may offer testing to be performed outside of a commercial clinical laboratory, such as (1) point-of-care testing that can be performed by clinicians in their offices; (2) complex testing that can be performed by IDNs in their own laboratories; and (3) home testing that can be carried out without requiring the services of outside providers.The supply of qualified technical, professional, managerial and other personnel, including cytotechs, phlebotomists and processors, is currently constrained; competition for qualified employees, even across different industries, is intense, including as individuals leave the job market.The process of combining acquisitions may be disruptive to our businesses and may cause an interruption of, or a loss of momentum in, such businesses as a result of the following difficulties, among others: • loss of key customers or employees; • difficulty in standardizing information and other systems; • difficulty in consolidating facilities and infrastructure; • failure to maintain the quality or timeliness of services that our Company has historically provided; • diversion of management's attention from the day-to-day business of our Company as a result of the need to deal with the foregoing disruptions and difficulties; and • the added costs of dealing with such disruptions.These factors include: the timing, extent, trajectory and duration of any pandemic; increases in COVID-19 infection rates and the geographic location of such increases; the development, availability, distribution and effectiveness of vaccines and treatments; the imposition of protective public safety measures; and the impact of any pandemic on supply chain and the global economy.
