RISK FACTORSThe following risk factors as well as the other information included in this Form 10-K, including“ Management’ s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” and our consolidated financial statements and related notes thereto should be carefully considered.See Note 1“ Summary of Significant Accounting Policies” and Note 16“ Income Taxes” to our audited consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Form 10-K for additional information related to our accounting for income tax matters.As of December 31, 2022, we had approximately 17,000 employees of which approximately 5,000 were located in the United States.See Note 21“ Contingencies” to our audited consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Form 10-K. The nature of our products creates the possibility of significant product liability and warranty claims, which could harm our business.See Note 9“ Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets” to our audited consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Form 10-K for additional information related to impairment testing for goodwill and other intangible assets and the associated charges taken.See Note 19“ Hedging Activities, Derivative Instruments and Credit Risk” to our audited consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Form 10-K. If the financial institutions that are part of the syndicate of our Revolving Credit Facility fail to extend credit under our Revolving Credit Facility, our liquidity and results of operations may be adversely affected.Non-U. S. operations and United States export sales could be adversely affected as a result of: political or economic instability in certain countries; differences in foreign laws, including increased difficulties in protecting intellectual property and uncertainty in enforcement of contract rights; credit risks; currency fluctuations, in particular, changes in currency exchange rates between the U. S. dollar, Euro, British Pound and the Chinese Renminbi; exchange controls; changes in and uncertainties with respect to tariffs and import/export trade restrictions (including changes in United States trade policy toward other countries, such as the imposition of tariffs and the resulting consequences), as well as other changes in political policy in the United States, China, the U. K. and certain European countries (including the impacts of the U. K.’ s national referendum resulting in the U. K.’ s withdrawal from the European Union); royalty and tax increases; nationalization of private enterprises, especially in China where we have material operations, supply chain dependencies and hold material cash balances; civil unrest and protests, strikes, acts of terrorism, war or other armed conflict; shipping products during times of crisis or war; and other factors inherent in foreign operations.In addition, acquisitions outside of the United States often involve additional or increased risks including, for example: • managing geographically separated organizations, systems and facilities; • integrating personnel with diverse business backgrounds and organizational cultures; • complying with non-U. S. regulatory requirements; • fluctuations in currency exchange rates; • enforcement of intellectual property rights in some non-U. S. countries; • difficulty entering new non-U. S. markets due to, among other things, consumer acceptance and business knowledge of these new markets; and • general economic and political conditions.See Note 3“ Discontinued Operations” of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information related to these transactions.The credit agreement governing the Senior Secured Credit Facilities contains a number of restrictive covenants that impose significant operating and financial restrictions on us and may limit our ability to engage in acts that may be in our best interest, including restrictions on our ability to: incur additional indebtedness and guarantee indebtedness; pay dividends, make other distributions in respect of, or repurchase or redeem capital stock; prepay, redeem or repurchase certain debt; make loans, investments and other restricted payments; sell or otherwise dispose of assets; incur liens; enter into transactions with affiliates; enter into agreements restricting our subsidiaries’ ability to pay dividends; consolidate, merge or sell all or substantially all of our assets; make needed capital expenditures; make strategic acquisitions, investments or enter into joint ventures; plan for or react to market conditions or otherwise execute our business strategies; and engage in business activities, including future opportunities, that may be in our interest.We incurred restructuring charges of $29.3 million and $13.4 million in the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively.In 2020, we recognized an impairment charge related to other intangible assets of $19.9 million within the Industrial Technologies and Services segment.As of December 31, 2022, we had total indebtedness of $2,752.6 million, and we had availability under the Revolving Credit Facility of $1,100 million.We will be exposed to credit-related losses which could impact the results of operations in the event of fluctuations in the fair value of the interest rate swaps due to a change in the credit worthiness or non-performance by the counterparties to the interest rate swaps.The decrease from 2021 was primarily due to the $150 million equity grant to nearly 16,000 employees worldwide announced in the third quarter of 2020 becoming fully vested in the third quarter of 2022.The increase in accounts receivable was primarily due to the increase in revenue in the fourth quarter of 2022 compared to the fourth quarter of 2021 and to acquisitions completed in 2022.The multiples are developed by first calculating the market value of equity of the guideline companies and then adjusting these multiples for cash and debt to arrive at a BEV multiple.The decrease in other income, net was primarily due to a lower gain from settling post-acquisition contingencies in the 2022 period compared to the 2021 period, partially offset by an increase in interest income from holdings of cash and cash equivalents.We measure Free Cash Flow as cash flows from operating activities less capital expenditures.The Company has determined that it will follow the period cost method (option 1 above).Adjusted EBITDA as a percentage of revenues increased 120 basis points to 24.3% in 2022 from 23.1% in 2021.Segment Adjusted EBITDA Margin increased 100 bps to 25.8% from 24.8% in 2021.Selling and Administrative ExpensesSelling and administrative expenses consist of (i) salaries and other employee-related expenses for our selling and administrative functions and other activities not associated with the manufacture of products or delivery of services to customers; (ii) facility operating expenses for selling and administrative activities, including office rent, maintenance, depreciation and insurance; (iii) marketing and direct costs of selling products and services to customers including internal and external sales commissions; (iv) research and development expenditures; (v) professional and consultant fees; (vi) employee related stock-based compensation for our selling and administrative functions and (vii) other miscellaneous expenses.The increase was primarily the result of recognizing a full year of amortization of assets acquired in the second half of 2021, partially offset by the impact of foreign currency translation.The excess of the cost of the acquired business and the fair value of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed is recognized as goodwill.Significant judgment is required in estimating the fair value of identifiable intangible assets and in assigning their respective useful lives.Under the income approach, fair value is determined based on the present value of estimated future cash flows, discounted at an appropriate risk-adjusted rate.The application of the market multiples method entails the development of book value multiples based on the market value of the guideline companies.When a loss is considered probable and reasonably estimable, we record a liability in the amount of our best estimate for the ultimate loss.
