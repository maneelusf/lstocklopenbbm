Numerous other factors impact our traffic growth including: • the pace of introduction of OTT video delivery initiatives by our customers; • the popularity of our customers’ streaming offerings as compared to those offered by companies that do not use our solutions; • variation in the popularity of online gaming; • media and other customers utilizing their own data centers and implementing delivery approaches that limit or eliminate reliance on third-party providers like us; and • general macro-economic and geopolitical conditions and industry pressures.With the restrictions on businesses intended to curb the spread of the COVID-19 virus, nearly all of our employees worldwide have been working remotely since the first quarter of 2020, and we are not requiring employees whose roles do not require in-person presence to perform their jobs to return to offices before May 1, 2022.Any litigation or claims, whether or not valid, brought against us or pursuant to which we indemnify our customers or partners could result in substantial costs and diversion of resources and require us to do one or more of the following: • cease selling, incorporating or using features, functionalities, products or services that incorporate the challenged intellectual property; • pay substantial damages and incur significant litigation expenses; • obtain a license from the holder of the infringed intellectual property right, which license may not be available on reasonable terms or at all; or • redesign products or services.Our ability to increase our overall revenue also depends on many other factors including how well we can: • retain existing customers, including by maintaining the levels of existing services they buy and by delivering consistent and quality performance levels; • upsell new solutions to existing customers; • expand our customer base; • develop and sell innovative and appealing new solutions; • address potential commoditization of our delivery-based solutions, which can lead to lower prices and loss of customers to competitors; • counteract multi-vendor policies that could cause customers to reduce their reliance on us; • handle other competitive threats to our business; • adapt to changes in our customer contracting models from a committed revenue structure to a "pay-as-you-go" approach, which would make it easier for customers to stop doing business with us, or from traditional overage billing models to ones that do not incorporate surcharges for usage above committed levels; and 45 Table of Contents • manage the impact of changes in general economic conditions, public health issues, natural disasters and public unrest on our ability to sell, market and provide our solutions.As a result, some of these competitors may be able to: • develop superior products or services; • leverage better name recognition, particularly in the security market; • enter new markets more easily; • gain greater market acceptance for their products and services; • expand their offerings more efficiently and more rapidly; • bundle their products that are competitive with ours with other solutions they offer in a way that makes our offerings less appealing to current and potential customers; • more quickly adapt to new or emerging technologies and changes in customer requirements; • take advantage of acquisition, investment and other opportunities more readily; • offer lower prices than ours, including at levels that may not be profitable; • spend more money on the promotion, marketing and sales of their products and services; and 46 Table of Contents • spend more money on research and development, including offering higher salaries to talented professionals which may impact our ability to hire or retain engineering and other personnel.We regularly face attempts to gain unauthorized access or deliver malicious software to the Akamai Intelligent Edge Platform and our internal IT systems, with the goal of stealing proprietary information related to our business, products, employees and customers; disrupting our systems and services or those of our customers or others; or demanding ransom to return control of such systems and services.Any actual, alleged or perceived breach of network security in our systems or networks, or any other actual, alleged or perceived data security incident we or our third-party suppliers suffer, can result in damage to our reputation; negative publicity; loss of channel partners, customers and sales; loss of competitive advantages; increased costs to remedy any problems and otherwise respond to any incident; regulatory investigations and enforcement actions; costly litigation; and other liability.These risks include: • uncertainty regarding liability for content or services, including uncertainty as a result of local laws and lack of legal precedent; • loss of revenues if the U. S. or foreign governments impose limitations on doing business with significant current or potential customers; • adjusting to different employee/employer relationships and different regulations governing such relationships; • becoming subject to regulatory oversight; • corporate and personal liability for alleged or actual violations of laws and regulations; • difficulty in staffing, developing and managing foreign operations as a result of distance, language, cultural differences or regulations such as those implemented in connection with the COVID-19 pandemic; • theft of intellectual property in high-risk countries where we operate; • difficulties in transferring funds from, or converting currencies in, certain countries; • managing the costs and processes necessary to comply with export control, sanctions, anti-corruption, data protection and competition laws and regulations; • geopolitical developments that impact our customers’ ability to operate or deliver content to a country; • other circumstances outside of our control such as trade disputes, political unrest, public health emergencies such as the COVID-19 pandemic and natural disasters that could disrupt our ability to provide services or limit customer purchases of them; • reliance on channel partners over which we have limited control or influence on a day-to-day basis; and • potentially adverse tax consequences.We are subject to laws and regulations worldwide that differ among jurisdictions, affecting our operations in areas such as intellectual property ownership and infringement; tax; anti-corruption; foreign exchange controls and cash repatriation; data privacy; competition; and employment.Violations of these laws and regulations can result in fines; criminal sanctions against us, our officers or our employees; prohibitions on the conduct of our business; and damage to our reputation.Acquisitions and other complex transactions are accompanied by a number of risks, including the following: • difficulty integrating the technologies, operations and personnel of acquired businesses; • potential disruption of our ongoing business; • potential distraction of management; • diversion of business resources from core operations; • financial consequences, such as increased operating expenses and other dilutive effects on our earnings, particularly in the current environment where we have seen escalating valuations of many technology companies; • assumption of legal risks related to compliance with laws, including privacy and anti-corruption regulations; • failure to realize synergies or other expected benefits; • acquisition of IT systems that expose us to cybersecurity risks; • increased accounting charges such as impairment of goodwill or intangible assets, amortization of intangible assets acquired and a reduction in the useful lives of intangible assets acquired; and • potential unknown liabilities associated with acquired businesses.Legal and Regulatory RisksEvolving privacy regulations could negatively impact our profitability and business operations.Trading prices may continue to fluctuate in response to a number of events and factors, including the following: • quarterly variations in operating results; • announcements by our customers related to their businesses that could be viewed as impacting their usage of our solutions; • market speculation about whether we are a takeover target or considering a strategic transaction; • announcements by competitors; • activism by any single large stockholder or combination of stockholders or rumors about such activity; • changes in financial estimates and recommendations by securities analysts; • failure to meet the expectations of securities analysts; • purchases or sales of our stock by our officers and directors; • general economic conditions and other macro-economic factors; • repurchases of shares of our common stock; • successful cyber-attacks affecting our network or systems; • performance by other companies in our industry; and • geopolitical conditions such as acts of terrorism, military conflicts or global pandemics.• We have experienced variations in certain types of revenue from quarter to quarter.Under specified circumstances, the facility can be increased to up to $1.0 billion in aggregate principal amount.In particular, we typically experience higher revenue in the fourth quarter of each year for some of our solutions as a result of holiday season activity.In the first nine months of 2021 as compared to the same period in 2020, we experienced a decline in revenue from website and application delivery solutions due to the above factors, particularly in the U. S. commerce vertical, and slowing media traffic growth.• Network build-out and supporting service costs represent another significant portion of our cost of revenue.We expect sales and marketing costs to slightly increase in the fourth quarter of 2021, as compared to the prior three quarters in 2021, due to the acquisition of Guardicore.The restructuring charges for the three-and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2020 were primarily the result of management actions initiated in the fourth quarter of 2019 to focus on investments having the potential to accelerate revenue growth.We expect to record additional losses in the fourth quarter of 2021 and beyond as GO-NET continues executing on the early stages of its business plan.We will need to continue to effectively manage our bandwidth costs to maintain current levels of profitability.We expect to see higher depreciation expense for the remainder of 2021 to reflect such deployment of equipment.Guardicore has approximately 270 employees, and the acquisition is expected to be dilutive to our earnings per share at least through 2022.Interest expense is related to our debt transactions, which are described in Note 7 to the condensed consolidated financial statements.
