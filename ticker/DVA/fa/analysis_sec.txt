Maintaining these restrictive operational protocols may also have adversely impacted our strategic initiatives, such as our strategy to continue to build our abilities to offer home dialysis options and expanding our integrated care capabilities.Changes to the continuously evolving healthcare regulatory landscape may also have the potential to generate opportunities with relative ease of entry for certain smaller and/or non-traditional providers and we may be competing with them for patients in an asymmetrical environment with respect to data and/or regulatory requirements given our status as an ESRD service provider.Finally, there have also been rule making and legislative efforts at both the federal and state level regarding the use of charitable premium assistance for ESRD patients that may establish new conditions for coverage standards for dialysis facilities.Any allegations against us, our personnel or our representatives in such matters may among other things harm our reputation, stock price, and our various business relationships and/or contracts related to our business, and these impacts may be material.We continue to experience downward pressure on some of our rates with commercial payors as a result of these and other general conditions in the market, including, among other things, as employers seek to shift to less expensive options for medical services or as commercial payors dedicate increased focus on dialysis services.The ultimate result of our negotiations with payors cannot be predicted as they occur in a highly competitive environment and are influenced by marketplace dynamics such as those previously discussed.Many patients with commercial and government insurance also rely on financial assistance from charitable organizations, such as the American Kidney Fund.The use of charitable premium assistance for ESRD patients has also faced challenges and inquiries from legislators, regulators and other governmental authorities, and this may continue.This developing market may create additional opportunities for competition with relative ease of entry, and if we are unable to successfully adapt to these or other marketplace developments, which, among other things, may include regulatory changes with respect to conditions of coverage, in a timely and compliant manner, we may experience a material adverse impact on our growth in home-based dialysis or a reduction in our overall number of patients, among other things.Privacy and data protection laws are also evolving nationally, providing for enhanced state privacy rights that are broader than the current federal privacy rights, and may add additional compliance costs and legal risks to our U. S. operations.Our business and operations also rely on certain critical IT vendors that support such processing, transmission and storage (which have become more relevant and important given the information security issues and risks that are intensified through remote work arrangements).In addition to these large and medium-sized competitors with substantial financial resources and other established participants in the dialysis space, we also compete with individual nephrologists who have opened their own dialysis units or facilities.Although these and other potential competitors may face operational or financial challenges, the evolving nature of the dialysis and pre-dialysis marketplaces have presented some opportunities for relative ease of entry for these and other potential competitors.If a proposed transaction or series of transactions is subject to challenge under antitrust or competition laws, we may incur substantial legal costs, management’ s attention and resources may be diverted, and if we are found to have violated these or other related laws, regulations or requirements, we could suffer severe consequences that could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows and could materially harm our reputation and stock price.Many of our joint ventures with physicians or physician groups also have certain physician owners providing medical director services to centers we own and operate.In addition, these risks 51 are particularly heightened for our patients in part because individuals with chronic illness may be more susceptible to the adverse effects of epidemics or other public health crises and also because any natural or other disaster, political instability or adverse weather event that disrupts or limits the operation of any of our centers or other facilities or services may delay or otherwise impact the critical services we provide to dialysis patients.Provisions in our organizational documents, our compensation programs and policies and certain requirements under Delaware law may deter changes of control and may make it more difficult for our stockholders to change the composition of our Board of Directors and take other corporate actions that our stockholders would otherwise determine to be in their best interests.These ancillary services, including our international operations, generated revenues of approximately $1.101 billion in 2022, representing approximately 9% of our consolidated revenues.Our DSO calculation is based on the most recent quarter’ s average revenues per day.If we fail to meet the minimum purchase commitments under these contracts during any year, we are required to pay the difference to the supplier.Our outpatient, home-based and hospital inpatient dialysis services comprise approximately 76%, 18% and 6% of our U. S. dialysis revenues, respectively.Our U. S. dialysis general and administrative expenses represented 9.8% and 8.7% of our U. S. dialysis revenues in 2022 and 2021, respectively.U. S. dialysis businessAs of December 31, 2022, our U.

S. dialysis business, our home-based dialysis and hospital inpatient dialysis services are operationally integrated with our outpatient dialysis centers and related laboratory services.Commercial payors (including hospital dialysis services) represent approximately 33% of U. S. dialysis patient services revenues.
