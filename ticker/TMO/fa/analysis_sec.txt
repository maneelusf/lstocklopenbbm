In addition, we have definite-lived intangible assets totaling $16.21 billion as of December 31, 2022.As of December 31, 2022, we had approximately $34.49 billion in outstanding indebtedness.Our business is affected by general economic conditions and related uncertainties affecting markets in which we operate.Demand for some of our products depends on capital spending policies of our customers and on government funding policies.Our business strategy includes the acquisition of technologies and businesses that complement or augment our existing products and services.The heightened stakeholder focus on ESG issues related to our business requires the continuous monitoring of various and evolving laws, regulations, standards and expectations and the associated reporting requirements.These fluctuations could also adversely affect the demand for products and services provided by us.Our largest customer in the laboratory products business is also a significant competitor.If the global economy and financial markets, or economic conditions in Europe, the U. S. or other key markets, continue to be unstable, they could adversely affect the business, results of operations and financial condition of the company and its customers, distributors, and suppliers, having the effect of: • reducing demand for some of our products; • increasing the rate of order cancellations or delays; • increasing the risk of excess and obsolete inventories; • increasing pressure on the prices for our products and services; • causing supply interruptions, which could disrupt our ability to produce our products; and • creating longer sales cycles, and greater difficulty in collecting sales proceeds and slower adoption of new technologies.• tariffs imposed by the U. S. on goods from other countries and tariffs imposed by other countries on U. S. goods, including the tariffs adopted by the U. S. government on various imports from China and by the Chinese government on certain U. S. goods; • the impact of public health epidemics/pandemics on the global economy, such as the COVID-19 pandemic; • uncertainties regarding the collectability of accounts receivable; • the imposition of governmental controls; • diverse data privacy and protection requirements; • supply interruptions, which could disrupt our ability to produce our products; • increases in materials, energy, labor or other manufacturing-related costs or higher supply chain logistics costs; • negative consequences from changes in tax laws; • difficulty in staffing and managing widespread operations; • differing labor regulations; • differing protection of intellectual property; • unexpected changes in regulatory requirements; and • geopolitical uncertainty or turmoil, including terrorism and war.An impasse in federal government budget decisions could lead to substantial delays or reductions in federal spending.To address this issue, we are pursuing a number of strategies to improve our internal growth, including: • strengthening our presence in selected geographic markets; • allocating research and development funding to products with higher growth prospects; • developing new applications for our technologies; • expanding our service offerings; • continuing key customer initiatives; • combining sales and marketing operations in appropriate markets to compete more effectively; • finding new markets for our products; and • continuing the development of commercial tools and infrastructure to increase and support cross-selling opportunities of products and services to take advantage of our depth in product offerings.A significant disruption in, or breach in security of, our information technology systems or violation of data privacy laws could adversely affect our business.Any of these disruptions or other events outside of our control, such as strikes or other labor unrest, could have an adverse effect on our results of operations.A failure of our quality control systems could result in problems with facility operations or preparation or provision of products.Also, an acceleration of the debt under certain of our debt instruments would trigger an event of default under other of our debt instruments.Certain definite-lived intangible assets have largely independent cash flows.In Europe, strong sales were more than offset during 2022 due to lower COVID-19 testing demand.• The expense associated with the amortization of acquisition-related intangible assets because a significant portion of the purchase price for acquisitions may be allocated to intangible assets that have lives of up to 20 years.Markets served include pharmaceutical and biotech, academic and government, industrial and applied, as well as healthcare and diagnostics.Since 2020, the Life Sciences Solutions and Specialty Diagnostics segments as well as the laboratory products business have supported COVID-19 diagnostic testing, scaling and evolving their molecular diagnostics solutions and plastic consumables businesses to respond to the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic.The European viral vector manufacturing business provides manufacturing services for vaccines and therapies to biotechnology companies and large biopharma customers.The acquisition enables the company to accelerate the availability of reliable and accurate advanced molecular diagnostics at the point of care.On December 8, 2021, the company acquired, within the Laboratory Products and Biopharma Services segment, PPD, Inc., a U. S.-based global provider of clinical research services to the pharma and biotech industry.PeproTech provides bioscience reagents known as recombinant proteins, including cytokines and growth factors.Mesa Biotech has developed and commercialized a PCR based rapid point-of-care testing platform available for detecting infectious diseases including COVID-19.22 THERMO FISHER SCIENTIFIC INC. Operating ActivitiesDuring 2022, cash provided by income was offset in part by investments in working capital.
