Potential impacts of current or proposed legal or regulatory requirements include, without limitation, the following: • As part of the debate in Washington, D. C. and in state legislatures, there has been increasing focus on the framework of the U. S. retirement system.Our operating results are dependent on the level of our expenses, which can vary significantly for many reasons, including: • expenses incurred in connection with our multi-year strategic plan to strengthen our long-term competitive position; • variations in the level of total compensation expense due to changes in, among other things, bonuses, stock-based awards, employee benefit costs due to regulatory or plan design changes, our employee count and mix, competitive factors, market performance, and inflation; • changes in the level of our advertising and promotion expenses, including the costs of expanding investment advisory services to investors outside of the U. S. and further penetrating U. S. distribution channels; • expenses and capital costs incurred to maintain and enhance our administrative and operating services infrastructure, such as technology assets, depreciation, amortization, and research and development; • changes in the costs incurred for third-party service providers that perform certain administrative and operating services; • changes in expenses that are correlated to our assets under management, such as distribution and servicing fees; • a future impairment of investments that is recognized in our consolidated balance sheet; • a future impairment of goodwill or other intangible assets that is recognized in our consolidated balance sheet; • unanticipated material fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates applicable to the costs of our operations abroad; • unanticipated costs incurred to protect investor accounts and client goodwill; • future changes to legal and regulatory requirements and potential litigation; and • disruptions of third-party services such as communications, power, cloud services, transfer agent, investment management, trading, and accounting systems.A significant portion of our business operations are concentrated in the Baltimore, Maryland region; Colorado Springs, Colorado; and in London, England.In addition, we maintain offices with associates in many other global locations, including Sydney, Australia; Hong Kong; Singapore; Tokyo, Japan; and Luxembourg.Our foreign business operations are also subject to the following risks: • difficulty in managing, operating, and marketing our international operations; • the inability to transact in various investments or to repatriate the proceeds from our investments from countries outside the U. S.; • the potential nationalization of our property or that of the companies in our investment portfolios; • fluctuations in currency exchange rates which may result in substantial negative effects on assets under our management, revenues, expenses, and assets in our U. S. dollar based financial statements; and • significant adverse changes in international legal and regulatory environments.• We remain subject to various state, federal and international laws and regulations (and associated judicial decisions) related to data collection and use; privacy and data protection; cybersecurity; current and emerging technology; data storage, localization, retention and destruction; data disclosure, transfer, availability, and integrity; notification of regulators and/or impacted parties regarding adverse data-related events; and other similar matters that can concern the data of our clients and employees.For example, the EU’ s recent action plan on financing sustainable growth includes initiatives to integrate ESG into the financial system.We are subject to competition in all aspects of our business from other financial institutions.Climate-related physical risks arise from the direct impacts of a changing climate in the short-and long-term.Any of these risks could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations, and value of our common stock.Significant errors for which we are responsible could impact our reputation, results of operations, financial condition or liquidity.Non-operating investment activity for the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020 comprised the following: While market declines tempered some in the last quarter of 2022, our overall investment portfolio valuations for 2022 were negatively impacted by market declines caused by the continued elevated inflation, supply chain disruptions, and a more aggressive pace of Federal Reserve interest rate increases.For the first half of 2022, we voluntarily waived $9.3 million, or less than.The average annualized fee rate earned on our assets under management was 42.3 basis points for the fourth quarter of 2022.Impairment charges recorded in the fourth quarter of 2022 impacted the lower operating income that drove the GAAP diluted earnings per share decrease.On a non-GAAP basis, operating expenses were $3,840.3 million as compared with $3,342.7 million in 2020.For 2021, compensation and related costs, excluding non-cash amortization of certain acquisition-related retention agreements, capital allocation-based income compensation, and supplemental savings plan, increased $229.4 million, or 11.1%, for 2021 as compared with 2020.General, administrative, and other costs were $412.2 million for 2022, $383.6 million for 2021, and $316.1 million for 2020.Additionally, during the fourth quarter of 2022, we determined that certain of these intangible assets were impaired and recognized related impairment charges totaling $175.1 million.The decrease in our operating margin in 2022 compared with 2021 is primarily driven by a decrease in investment advisory revenue as a result of lower average assets under management and higher operating expenses.The decrease in 12b-1 revenue is offset entirely by a decrease in the costs paid to third-party intermediaries that source these assets and is reported in distribution and servicing expense.Also contributing to the increase in costs was a $88.5 million increase in salaries, benefits and related employee costs due to modest increases in base salaries at the beginning of the year as well as an increase in our average headcount, excluding the transition of 800 T. Rowe Price operations and technology associates to FIS on August 1, 2021 and the addition of OHA associates at the end of the year.The decrease was primarily driven by lower average assets under management in certain share classes of the U. S. mutual funds that earn 12 (b)-1 fees.The decrease was primarily driven by a decrease in media advertising spend during 2022, partially offset by higher promotion-related costs.
