For example, in April 2020, we announced a security incident involving a Maze ransomware attack.Among other things, many of our and our clients’ offices have been closed and employees have been working from home and many consumer-facing businesses have closed or are operating at a significantly reduced level to observe various social distancing requirements and government-mandated measures.While a number of these policy changes and executive orders failed to be enforced or enacted into law, the current administration has continued to explore visa and immigration reform.The OECD has also undertaken a new project focused on“ Addressing the Tax Challenges of the Digitalization of the Economy.”Clients may reduce demand for services quickly and with little warning, which may cause us to incur extra costs where we have employed more personnel than client demand supports.In addition to large, global competitors, we face competition in many geographic markets from numerous smaller, local competitors that may have more experience with operations in these markets, have well-established relationships with our desired clients, or be able to provide services and solutions at lower costs or on terms more attractive to clients than we can.Changes in tax laws or in their interpretation or enforcement, failure by us to adapt our corporate structure and intercompany arrangements to enhance our global tax profile or adverse outcomes of tax audits, investigations or proceedings could have a material adverse effect on our effective tax rate, results of operations and financial condition.The interpretation of tax laws and regulations in the many jurisdictions in which we operate and the related tax accounting principles are complex and require considerable judgment to determine our income taxes and other tax liabilities worldwide.The following are several examples of changes in tax laws that may impact us: • The Tax Reform Act was enacted in December 2017 and made a number of significant changes to the corporate tax regime in the United States.The U. S. federal government is also considering further tax reform that could increase corporate tax rates.Similarly, the European Commission and various jurisdictions have introduced proposals to or passed laws that impose a separate tax on specified digital services.* Not meaningful During 2021, revenues increased by $1,855 million as compared to 2020, representing growth of 11.1%, or 10.0% on a constant currency basis 3.The loss is excluded from Adjusted Operating Margin 2 and Adjusted Diluted EPS 2.Evaluation of goodwill for impairment requires judgment, including the identification of reporting units, assignment of assets, liabilities and goodwill to reporting units and determination of the fair value of each reporting unit.2021 Financial Results GAAP Adjusted GAAP Adjusted GAAP AdjustedDuring the year ended December 31, 2021, revenues increased by $1,855 million as compared to the year ended December 31, 2020, representing growth of 11.1%, or 10.0% on a constant currency basis 1.Our operating margin and Adjusted Operating Margin 1 increased to 15.3% and 15.4%, respectively, for the year ended December 31, 2021 from 12.7% and 14.4%, respectively, for the year ended December 31, 2020.For the year ended December 31, 2021, our attrition rate, including both voluntary and involuntary, was 30.8% as compared to 20.6% for the year ended December 31, 2020.Revenues of $18,507 million by geographic market were as follows for the year ended December 31, 2021: North America continues to be our largest market, representing 73.7% of total revenues and 56.9% of total growth for the year ended December 31, 2021.We finished the year ended December 31, 2021 with approximately 330,600 employees as compared to 289,500 employees for the year ended December 31, 2020.Attrition, including both voluntary and involuntary, was approximately 30.8% for the year ended December 31, 2021.See Note 7 to our consolidated financial statements for a description of our operating lease obligations.For the three months ended December 31, 2021, our annualized attrition rate, including both voluntary and involuntary, was 34.6% as compared to 19.0% for the three months ended December 31, 2020.
