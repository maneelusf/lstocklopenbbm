Substantially all of our apartment leases are for a term of one year or less.“ Properties—Other Land and Real Estate Assets,” in the event that the fair market value, less the cost to dispose of a parcel, changes such that it is less than the carrying basis of the parcel, we would be subject to an impairment charge, which would reduce our net income.Because these leases generally permit the residents to leave at the end of the lease term without penalty, our rental revenues are impacted by declines in market rents more quickly than if our leases were for longer terms.If a U. S. stockholder sells the stock it receives as a dividend in order to pay this tax, the sales proceeds may be less than the amount included in income with respect to the dividend, depending on the market price of our stock at the time of the sale.At times we invest directly and indirectly in real estate as a partner or a co-venturer with other investors.As of December 31, 2022, 4.9% of our apartment homes at current operating communities were under income limitations such as these.Our tax-exempt bonds may require us to obtain a guarantee from a financial institution of payment of the principal and interest on the bonds, such as a letter of credit, surety bond, guarantee agreement or other additional collateral.Gross rental revenue provided by leased commercial space in our portfolio represented 1.7% of our total revenue in 2022.Many of our markets, particularly those located in coastal cities, are exposed to risks associated with inclement or severe weather including those arising from climate change such as hurricanes, severe winter storms and coastal flooding.Consequently, we may be considered to have been an operator of such properties and, therefore, potentially liable for removal or remediation costs or other potential costs which relate to the release or presence of hazardous or toxic substances or petroleum products at such properties.The additional tax liability resulting from the failure to qualify as a REIT would significantly reduce or eliminate the amount of funds available for distribution to our stockholders.These provisions include the following: 18 Table of ContentsOur charter authorizes our Board of Directors to issue up to 50,000, 000 shares of preferred stock without stockholder approval and to establish the preferences and rights, including voting rights, of any series of preferred stock issued.You should carefully review Part I, Item 1A. "Risk Factors" of this Form 10-K for a discussion of the risks associated with our investment activity.In addition, FFO and Core FFO as calculated by other REITs may not be comparable to our calculations of FFO and Core FFO. FFO and Core FFO also do not represent cash generated from operating activities in accordance with GAAP, and therefore should not be considered an alternative to net cash flows from operating activities, as determined by GAAP, as a measure of liquidity.Amounts available under the Commercial Paper Program may be issued, repaid and re-issued from time to time, with the maximum aggregate face or principal amount outstanding at any one time not to exceed $500,000, 000.In such instances, we will not realize the increased revenues and earnings that we expected from such Development Rights or reconstruction activity and significant losses could be incurred.We do not undertake a duty to update these forward-looking statements, and therefore they may not represent our estimates and assumptions after the date of this report.You should not rely on forward-looking statements because they involve known and unknown risks, uncertainties and other factors, some of which are beyond our control.This report, including the following MD & A, contains forward-looking statements regarding future events or trends that should be read in conjunction with the factors described under“ Forward-Looking Statements” included in this report.We believe that our current capital structure will continue to provide financial flexibility to access capital on attractive terms.We believe our portfolio management activity through dispositions, development and acquisitions will continue to create long-term value.In addition, we held a direct or indirect ownership interest in Development Rights to develop an additional 39 communities that, if developed as expected, will contain an estimated 13,312 apartment homes.Discussion of our operating results for 2021 and comparison to 2020 can be found in Item 7.37 Table of ContentsOur results of operations in future periods may be impacted directly or indirectly by uncertainties such as the lingering effects of the COVID-19 pandemic (the "Pandemic") and the recent increases in inflation.We believe that, in order to understand our operating results, FFO and Core FFO should be considered in conjunction with net income as presented in the Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income included elsewhere in this report.The timing and amount of actual losses that will be incurred, if any, is to be determined.When we source capital, we take into account both our view of the most cost effective alternative available and our desire to maintain a balance sheet that provides us with flexibility.In addition, some of our secured borrowings include yield maintenance, defeasance, or prepayment penalty provisions, which would result in us incurring an additional charge in the event of a full or partial prepayment of outstanding principal before the 44 Table of Contentsscheduled maturity.However, we may also elect to cash settle or net share settle a forward sale agreement.For both our unsecured and secured notes, a portion of the principal of these notes may be repaid prior to maturity.In addition, to the extent we have amounts outstanding under the Commercial Paper Program, we are obligated to repay the short-term indebtedness at maturity through either current cash on hand or by incurring other indebtedness, including by way of borrowing under our Credit Facility.Although we believe we will have the capacity to meet our currently anticipated liquidity needs, we cannot assure you that capital from additional debt financing or debt or equity offerings will be available or, if available, that they will be on terms we consider satisfactory.Before beginning new construction or reconstruction activity in 2023, including activity related to communities owned by unconsolidated joint ventures, we plan to source sufficient capital to complete these undertakings, although we cannot assure you that we will be able to obtain such financing.In the event that financing cannot be obtained, we may abandon Development Rights, write off associated pre-development costs that were capitalized and/or forego reconstruction activity.These risks, uncertainties and other factors may cause our actual results, performance or achievements to differ materially from the anticipated future results, performance or achievements expressed or implied by these forward-looking statements.In addition, the effects of the Pandemic are likely to heighten the following risks, which we routinely face in our business.If our judgment or interpretation of the facts and circumstances relating to various transactions had been different, or different assumptions were made, it is possible that different accounting policies would have been applied, resulting in different financial results or a different presentation of our financial statements.Below is a discussion of the accounting policies that we consider critical to an understanding of our financial condition and operating results that may require complex or significant judgment in their application or require estimates about matters which are inherently uncertain.Capitalization begins when we determine that development of a future asset is probable and continues until the asset, or a portion of the asset, is delivered and is ready for its intended use.There may be a change in our operating expenses in the event that there are changes in accounting guidance governing capitalization or changes to our levels of development or redevelopment activity.Due to the subjectivity in determining whether a pursuit will result in the development of an apartment community, and therefore should be capitalized, the accounting for pursuit costs is a critical accounting estimate.Estimates of the undiscounted cash flows are sensitive to significant assumptions including future rental revenues, operating expenses, and our intent and ability to hold the related asset, which could be impacted by our expectations about the future.These costs can vary greatly, and the costs incurred in any given period may be significantly different in future years.We cannot predict the occurrence of future events that may cause an impairment assessment to be performed, or the likelihood of any future impairment charges, if any.
