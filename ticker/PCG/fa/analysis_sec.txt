In fact, in December 2017, the CPUC denied recovery of costs that San Diego Gas & Electric Company stated it had incurred as a result of the doctrine of inverse condemnation.MD & A, that can cause their actual financial results to differ materially from historical results or from anticipated future financial results.The Utility could be alleged or determined to be a cause of one or more of these wildfires.It is also possible that public pressure could grow leading to adverse changes in legislation, regulations, orders, or their interpretation.Additionally, the Utility could experience labor disruptions from personnel in those positions.If the Utility were to experience such a shortage or disruptions, work stoppages could occur.Long-term inflationary pressures may result in such prices continuing to increase more quickly than expected.The combined effects of extreme weather and climate change also impact this risk.“ Non-GAAP Core Earnings” means GAAP earnings adjusted for certain non-core items as described in the Plan.Other long-term trends could also increase costs for gas customers.MD & A and the Consolidated Financial Statements and related notes in Part II, Item 8,“ Financial Statements and Supplementary Data” of this 2022 Form 10-K. Any of these factors, in whole or in part, could materially affect PG & E Corporation’ s and the Utility’ s financial condition, results of operations, liquidity, and cash flows.The AB 1054 Wildfire Fund disallowance cap, which caps the amount of liability that the Utility could be required to bear for a catastrophic wildfire, is inapplicable if the Wildfire Fund administrator determines that the electric utility company’ s actions or inactions that resulted in the applicable wildfire constituted“ conscious or willful disregard for the rights and safety of others,” or the electric utility company fails to maintain a valid safety certification at the time the applicable wildfire ignited.In addition, if the Utility fails to maintain a valid safety certification at the time a wildfire ignites, the initial burden of proof in a prudency proceeding shifts from intervenors to the Utility.Participation in the Wildfire Fund is expected to have a material impact on PG & E Corporation’ s and the Utility’ s financial condition, results of operations, liquidity, and cash flows, and there can be no assurance that the benefits of participating in the Wildfire Fund ultimately outweigh these substantial costs.PG & E Corporation and the Utility could be liable as a result of the 2019 Kincade fire, the 2020 Zogg fire, the 2021 Dixie fire, the 2022 Mosquito fire, or future wildfires.Although there are a number of unknown facts surrounding Cal Fire’ s causation determinations of the 2019 Kincade fire, the 2020 Zogg fire, the 2021 Dixie fire, and the 2022 Mosquito fire, the Utility could be subject to significant liability in excess of recoveries that would be expected to have a material impact on PG & E Corporation’ s and the Utility’ s financial condition, results of operations, liquidity, and cash flows.If convicted of any of the charges, the Utility currently believes that its total losses associated with the 2020 Zogg fire could materially exceed the accrued estimated liabilities that PG & E Corporation and the Utility have recorded to reflect the lower end of the range of the reasonably estimable range of losses.Additionally, under the doctrine of inverse condemnation, courts have imposed liability against utilities on the grounds that losses borne by the person whose property was damaged through a public-use undertaking should be spread across the community that benefited from such undertaking, even if the utility is unable to recover these costs through rates.While the Utility continues to dispute the applicability of inverse condemnation to the Utility, there can be no assurance that the Utility will be successful in challenging the applicability of inverse condemnation in the 2019 Kincade fire, the 2020 Zogg fire, the 2021 Dixie fire, the 2022 Mosquito fire, or other litigation against PG & E Corporation or the Utility.The inability to recover all or a significant portion of costs in excess of insurance through rates or by collecting such rates in a timely manner could have a material effect on PG & E Corporation’ s and the Utility’ s financial condition, results of operations, liquidity, and cash flows.For more information on wildfire recovery risk, see“ The Wildfire Fund and other provisions of AB 1054 may not effectively mitigate the risk of liability for damages arising from catastrophic wildfires” above and Note 15 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8.38 The Utility may not effectively implement its wildfire mitigation initiatives.The amount of any fines, penalties, customer rebates or other payments (if PG & E Corporation or the Utility were to issue any credits, rebates or other payments in connection with any other wildfire mitigation initiatives or liability for damages) could have a material effect on PG & E Corporation’ s and the Utility’ s financial condition, results of operations, liquidity, and cash flows.An uninsured loss could have a material effect on PG & E Corporation’ s and the Utility’ s financial condition, results of operations, liquidity, and cash flows.Reducing natural gas use could lead to a reduction in the gas customer base and a diminished need for gas infrastructure and, as a result, could lead to certain gas assets no longer being“ used and useful,” potentially causing substantial investment value of gas assets to be stranded (under CPUC precedent, when an asset no longer meets the standard of“ used and useful,” the asset is removed from rate base, which results in a reduction in associated rate recovery).Inability by the Utility to recover through rates its investments into the natural gas system while still ensuring gas system safety and reliability could materially affect the Utility’ s financial condition, results of operations, liquidity, and cash flows.These industry changes, costs associated with complying with new regulatory developments and initiatives and with technological advancements, or the Utility’ s inability to successfully adapt to changes in the electric and gas industry, could materially affect the Utility’ s financial condition, results of operations, liquidity, and cash flows.Such events could subject the Utility to significant expenses, claims by customers or third parties, government inquiries, penalties for violation of applicable privacy laws, investigations, and regulatory actions that could result in material fines and penalties, loss of customers and harm to PG & E Corporation’ s and the Utility’ s reputation, any of which could have a material effect on PG & E Corporation’ s and the Utility’ s financial condition, results of operations, liquidity, and cash flows.In such an instance, the Utility could be required to record a charge for the remaining amount of its unrecovered investment and such charge could have a material effect on PG & E Corporation’ s and the Utility’ s financial condition, results of operations, liquidity, and cash flows.If the Utility’ s actual decommissioning costs, including the amounts held in the nuclear decommissioning trusts, exceed estimated costs, PG & E Corporation’ s and the Utility’ s financial condition, results of operations, liquidity, and cash flows could be materially affected.Any such occurrences could materially affect PG & E Corporation’ s and the Utility’ s financial condition, results of operations, liquidity, and cash flows.Approximately 25,000 circuit miles of the Utility’ s nearly 80,000 distribution overhead circuit miles and approximately 5,500 miles of the nearly 18,000 transmission overhead circuit miles are in such HFTDs, significantly more in total than other California IOUs.Any such event could have a material effect on PG & E Corporation’ s and the Utility’ s financial condition, results of operations, liquidity, and cash flows.If the CPUC fails to adjust the Utility’ s rates to reflect the impact of events or conditions caused by climate change, PG & E Corporation’ s and the Utility’ s financial condition, results of operations, liquidity, and cash flows could be materially affected.The Utility’ s costs to remediate groundwater contamination near the Hinkley natural gas compressor site and to abate the effects of the contamination, changes in estimated costs, and the extent to which actual remediation costs differ from recorded liabilities have had, and may continue to have, a material effect on PG & E Corporation’ s and the Utility’ s financial condition, results of operations, liquidity, and cash flows.Non-compliance with these rules could result in the imposition of material fines on PG & E Corporation and the Utility, other regulatory exposure, significant litigation, and reputational harm, which could materially affect PG & E Corporation’ s and the Utility’ s financial condition, results of operations, liquidity, and cash flows.The amount of such fines, penalties, or customer refunds depends on a variety of factors and could have a material effect on PG & E Corporation’ s and the Utility’ s financial condition, results of operations, liquidity, and cash flows.46 In addition to the amount of authorized revenues, PG & E Corporation’ s and the Utility’ s financial condition, results of operations, liquidity, and cash flows could be materially affected if the Utility’ s actual costs differ from authorized or forecast costs.The Utility’ s inability to service its substantial debt or access the financial markets on reasonable terms could have a material effect on PG & E Corporation’ s and the Utility’ s financial condition, results of operations, liquidity, and cash flows.Such payment may have a material adverse impact on PG & E Corporation’ s and the Utility’ s financial condition, results of operations, liquidity, and cash flows.The Ownership Restrictions remain in effect until the earliest of (i) the repeal, amendment, or modification of Section 382 (and any comparable successor provision) of the IRC, in a manner that renders the restrictions imposed by Section 382 of the IRC no longer applicable to PG & E Corporation, (ii) the beginning of a taxable year in which the Board of Directors of PG & E Corporation determines that no tax benefits attributable to net operating losses or other tax attributes are available, (iii) the date selected by the Board of Directors if it determines that the limitation amount imposed by Section 382 of the IRC as of such date in the event of an“ ownership change” of PG & E Corporation (as defined in Section 382 of the IRC and Treasury Regulation Sections 1.1502-91 et seq.)If the Internal Revenue Service successfully asserts that PG & E Corporation did undergo, or PG & E Corporation otherwise does undergo, an ownership change, the limitation on its net operating loss carryforwards and other tax attributes under Section 382 of the IRC could be material to PG & E Corporation’ s and the Utility’ s financial condition, results of operations, liquidity, and cash flows.Subject to the foregoing restrictions, any decision to declare and pay dividends in the future will be made at the discretion of PG & E Corporation’ s Board of Directors and will depend on, among other things, PG & E Corporation’ s results of operations, financial condition, cash requirements, contractual restrictions, and other factors that the Board of Directors may deem relevant.PG & E Corporation conducts its operations primarily through its subsidiary, the Utility, and substantially all of PG & E Corporation’ s consolidated assets are held by the Utility.Accordingly, PG & E Corporation’ s cash flow and its ability to meet its debt service obligations under its existing and future indebtedness are largely dependent upon the earnings and cash flows of the Utility and the distribution or other payment of these earnings and cash flows to PG & E Corporation in the form of dividends or loans or advances and repayment of loans and advances from the Utility.The Amended Articles and the Amended Bylaws contain provisions that may make the acquisition of PG & E Corporation more difficult without the approval of the Board of Directors, including the following: • until 2024, the Board of Directors will be divided into two equal classes, with members of each class elected in different years for different terms; • only holders of shares who are entitled to cast ten percent or more of the votes can request a special meeting of the shareholders, and any such request must satisfy the requirements specified in the Amended Bylaws; action by shareholders may otherwise only be taken at an annual or special meeting duly called by or at the direction of a majority of the Board of Directors, or action by written consent signed by shareholders owning at least the number of votes necessary to authorize the action at a meeting where all shares entitled to vote were present; • advance notice for all shareholder proposals is required; and • any person acquiring PG & E Corporation Equity Securities will be restricted from owning 4.75% or more of such Equity Securities (as determined for federal income tax purposes (see“ Tax Matters” in Item 7.PG & E Corporation’ s and the Utility’ s financial condition, results of operations, liquidity, and cash flows have been and could continue to be significantly affected by the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic.PG & E Corporation’ s and the Utility’ s financial condition, results of operations, liquidity, and cash flows have been (beginning in March 2020) and could continue to be significantly affected by the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic (and its variants), but the extent of such impact is uncertain.The consequences of a continued and prolonged outbreak and resulting governmental and regulatory orders have had and could continue to have a negative impact on the Utility’ s financial condition, results of operations, liquidity, and cash flows.PG & E Corporation and the Utility are unable to quantify the long-term potential impact of the changes in customer collections or changes in energy demand on earnings and cash flows due, in part, to uncertainties regarding the timing, duration and intensity of the COVID-19 outbreak and the resulting economic downturn.Under this structure, NEM customers do not pay their proportionate share of the cost of maintaining and operating the electric transmission and distribution system, including costs associated with funding social equity programs, subject to certain exceptions, while still receiving electricity from the system when their self-generation is inadequate to meet their electricity needs.If fewer customers receive gas from the Utility, the Utility’ s gas system maintenance costs, many of which cannot be reduced in the short term even if gas quantities decrease, would be borne by fewer customers.As a result, PG & E Corporation’ s and the Utility’ s financial condition, results of operations, liquidity, and cash flows could be materially affected.Inflation may negatively impact PG & E Corporation’ s and the Utility’ s financial conditions, results of operations, liquidity, and cash flows.Increases in inflation raises costs for labor, materials and services, and PG & E Corporation and the Utility may be unable to secure these resources on economically acceptable terms or offset such costs with increased revenues, operating efficiencies, or cost savings, which may adversely impact PG & E Corporation’ s and the Utility’ s financial conditions, results of operations, liquidity, and cash flows.
