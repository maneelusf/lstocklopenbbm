Unless we successfully develop resources, the scope of our business will decline, resulting in an adverse impact to our business.In addition, our ability to successfully develop our reserves is dependent on a number of factors, including our ability to successfully navigate political and regulatory challenges to obtain and renew rights to develop and produce hydrocarbons; our success at reservoir optimization; our ability to bring long-lead time, capital intensive projects to completion on budget and on schedule; and our ability to efficiently and profitably operate mature properties.In addition, some countries where we operate lack a fully independent judiciary system.Ordinary dividends are authorized and determined by our Board of Directors in its sole discretion and depend upon a number of factors, including: • Cash available for distribution; • Our results of operations and anticipated future results of operations; • Our financial condition, especially in relation to the anticipated future capital needs of our properties; • The level of distributions paid by comparable companies; • Our operating expenses; and • Other factors our Board of Directors deems relevant.VROC distributions are also authorized and determined by our Board of Directors in its sole discretion and depend upon a number of factors, including: • The anticipated level of distributions required to meet our capital returns commitment; • Forward prices; • The amount of cash we hold; • Total yield; and • Other factors our Board of Directors deems relevant.A successful attack may result in gaining unauthorized access to, or control of, and disclosure of sensitive information about our operations and our employees and/or partners; attempts to corrupt, sabotage, or render our data or systems (or those of third parties with whom we do business, including third-party cloud and IT service providers) unusable; theft or manipulation of our proprietary business information, whether from insiders or external threat actors; and cyberextortion for the return of data.Risk FactorsYou should carefully consider the following risk factors in addition to the other information included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. These risk factors are not the only risks we face.Our proved reserve information included in this annual report represents management’ s best estimates based on assumptions, as of a specified date, of the volumes to be recovered from underground accumulations of crude oil, bitumen, natural gas and NGLs.The full extent and duration of any such impacts cannot be predicted at this time because of the lack of certainty surrounding the pandemic.These laws and regulations continue to increase in both number and complexity and affect our operations with respect to, among other things: • Permits required in connection with exploration, drilling, production and other activities, including those issued by national, subnational, and local authorities; • The discharge of pollutants into the environment; • Emissions into the atmosphere, such as nitrogen oxides, sulfur dioxide, mercury and GHG emissions, including methane; • Carbon taxes; • The handling, use, storage, transportation, disposal and cleanup of hazardous materials and hazardous and nonhazardous wastes; • The dismantlement, abandonment and restoration of historic properties and facilities at the end of their useful lives; and • Exploration and production activities in certain areas, such as offshore environments, arctic fields, oil sands reservoirs and unconventional plays.While GFANZ members are not prohibited from having relationships with oil and gas companies, they are facing intense scrutiny for providing any sort of financial support to such companies, which may lead to greater restrictions on GFANZ members in the future.For example, in response to higher energy prices resulting from the conflict between Russia and Ukraine, in December 2022, Australia’ s Parliament passed legislation setting a one-year price cap on natural gas.In 2022, we expanded upon our global LNG business by increasing our ownership in APLNG by 10 percent to 47.5 percent.Our organic reserve replacement, which excludes a net decrease of 6 MMBOE from sales and purchases, was 177 percent in 2022.In 2022, Alaska contributed 16 percent of our consolidated liquids production and two percent of our consolidated natural gas production.During 2022, the Lower 48 contributed 64 percent of our consolidated liquids production and 72 percent of our consolidated natural gas production.In 2022, Canada contributed six percent of our consolidated liquids production and three percent of our consolidated natural gas production.During 2022, Asia Pacific contributed five percent of our consolidated liquids production and six percent of our consolidated natural gas production.Asset Acquisitions and DispositionsIn the first quarter of 2022, we completed the acquisition of an additional 10 percent interest in APLNG increasing our ownership to 47.5 percent.Burlington Resources LLC is 100 percent owned by ConocoPhillips Company.We also declared a first quarter ordinary dividend of $0.51 cents per share and a VROC of $0.60 cents per share.Other Expenses decreased $149 million primarily related to a gain of $127 million associated with the extinguishment of debt from the first quarter of 2022.A 100 basis-point decrease in the discount rate assumption would increase projected benefit obligations by $600 million.
