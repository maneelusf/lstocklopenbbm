K. and E. U. member states, among others, have introduced draft legislation or otherwise agreed to implement a global minimum tax that would be consistent with the OECD recommendations, beginning, for Aon, in 2024.As an Irish company, we are governed by the Irish Companies Act, which differs in some material respects from laws generally applicable to U. S. corporations and shareholders, including, among others, differences relating to interested director and officer transactions and shareholder lawsuits.Irish law generally provides that a board of directors may allot and issue shares (or rights to subscribe for or convert into shares) if authorized to do so by a company’ s constitution or by an ordinary resolution of shareholders.Irish law requires us to have available“ distributable profits” to pay dividends to shareholders and generally to make share repurchases and redemptions.We believe that we will have sufficient distributable profits for the foreseeable future.Additional amounts may be agreed to with, or required by, the U. K. pension plan trustees.Most of our purchase obligations are related to purchases of information technology services or other service contracts.If our assumptions or conditions change, the actual results we report may differ from these estimates.For arrangements that include variable consideration, the Company assesses whether any amounts should be constrained.Payment terms for other services vary but are typically over the contract term in installments.If we are required to record impairment charges in the future, they could materially impact our results of operations.We are required to assess the likelihood of material adverse judgments or outcomes, as well as potential ranges or probability of losses.Such objectives may be made on a personal, group or company level.We make assessments of future performance using subjective estimates, such as long-term plans.Income Taxes The effective tax rate on net income was 16.2% in 2022 and 32.3% in 2021.Foreign currency exchange rate movements may be significant and may distort true period-to-period comparisons of changes in revenue or pretax income.Our ability to access the market as a source of liquidity is dependent on investor demand, market conditions, and other factors.Input and output measures utilized vary based on the arrangement but typically include reports provided or days elapsed.These indicators may include a sustained significant decline in our share price and market capitalization, a significant decline in our expected future cash flows, or a significant adverse change in legal factors or in the business climate, among others.A component of an operating segment is a reporting unit if the component constitutes a business for which discrete financial information is available and segment management regularly reviews the operating results of that component.Preparation of forecasts and selection of the discount rate for use in the DCF model involve significant judgments, and changes in these estimates could affect the estimated fair value of one or more of our reporting units and could result in a goodwill impairment charge in a future period.Valuation allowances are evaluated periodically and will be subject to change in each future reporting period as a result of changes in various factors.Using different estimates, assumptions, and judgments in accounting for income taxes, especially those that deploy tax planning strategies, may result in materially different carrying values of income tax assets and liabilities and changes in our results of operations.
