Dominion Energy operates in active wholesale markets that expose it to price volatility for electricity and nuclear fuel as well as the credit risk of counterparties.Additionally, if any state utility commission does not allow recovery through base rates, on a timely basis, of costs incurred in providing service, the Company’ s future earnings could be negatively impacted.In addition, juries have demonstrated a willingness to grant large awards in certain cases, including personal injury claims.Accordingly, to the extent the instruments do not effectively hedge the Companies’ exposure to these currencies, including by default of the counterparty, adverse fluctuations in the applicable exchange rates would likely adversely affect the cost of the CVOW Commercial Project.Further, the computer systems that run the Companies’ facilities are not completely isolated from external networks.If downstream customers or upstream suppliers do not sufficiently reduce their GHG emissions, Dominion Energy may not achieve its net zero emissions goal.To the extent Dominion Energy does not enter into long-term power purchase agreements or otherwise effectively hedge its output, these changes in market prices could adversely affect its financial results.In addition, in the event that any of the contracted generation facilities experience a forced outage, Dominion Energy may not receive the level of revenue it anticipated.Some of Dominion Energy’ s operations are conducted through partnership arrangements, as noted above.Virginia has adopted the VCEA which establishes renewable energy and CO2 reduction targets for Virginia Power’ s generation fleet and grid operations, including the requirement that 100% of Virginia Power’ s electricity come from zero-carbon generation by the end of 2045.For example, in December 2022 electric utilities in North Carolina and Washington experienced physical attacks on substations with the damage causing power outages.See Note 10 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further information concerning the impairment related to certain of Dominion Energy’ s nonregulated solar generation assets.As of December 31, 2022, the calculated total debt to total capital ratio, pursuant to the terms of the agreements, was as follows: (1) Indebtedness as defined by the agreements excludes certain junior subordinated notes reflected as long-term debt as well as AOCI reflected as equity in the Consolidated Balance Sheets.Total estimated costs for such commitments at December 31, 2022 are presented in the table below.A 0.25% increase in the discount rate would have resulted in a $13 million increase to the impairment charge recorded.In June 2022, Dominion Energy repaid $450 million borrowed for general corporate purposes.At December 31, 2022 and 2021, Dominion Energy’ s nuclear decommissioning AROs totaled $1.9 billion and $2.0 billion, respectively.At December 31, 2022 and 2021, Dominion Energy had $117 million and $128 million, respectively, of unrecognized tax benefits.At December 31, 2022 and 2021, Dominion Energy had established $138 million and $140 million, respectively, of valuation allowances.At December 31, 2022, Dominion Energy had $920 million of available capacity under this authorization.These decreases were partially offset by the absence of charges associated with the settlement of the South Carolina electric base rate case, increased unrealized gains on economic hedging activities and the absence of a net loss on the sales of non-wholly-owned nonregulated solar facilities.At December 31, 2022, Dominion Energy had $450 million outstanding under this supplemental credit facility.In 2023, Dominion Energy expects to remarket approximately $160 million of its tax-exempt bonds.During 2022, Dominion Energy issued 2.4 million of such shares and received proceeds of $179 million.In September 2022, Dominion Energy redeemed all outstanding shares of Series A Preferred Stock for $1.6 billion.
