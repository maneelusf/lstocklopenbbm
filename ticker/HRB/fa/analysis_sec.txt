S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and other applicable foreign anti-corruption laws; (6) compliance with U. S. and international laws and regulations, including those concerning privacy, and data protection and retention; and (7) risks related to other government regulation or required compliance with local laws.These laws may contain different requirements or may be interpreted and applied inconsistently from jurisdiction to jurisdiction.The risks described below are not the only ones we face.We need liquidity sufficient to fund payments of dividends on our common stock and repurchases of our common stock.Additionally, we and many other tax return preparation firms compete by offering one or more of RTs, prepaid cards, RAs, other financial services and products, and other tax-related services and products, many of which are subject to regulatory scrutiny, litigation, and other risks.These networks, systems, and operations are potentially vulnerable to damage or interruption from upgrades and maintenance, network failure, hardware failure, software failure, power or telecommunications failures, cyberattacks, human error, and natural disasters.Alleged failures in this regard could result in negative impacts, including regulatory investigations, claims, legal actions, harm to our reputation and brands, fines, penalties, and other damages.INFORMATION SECURITY, CYBERSECURITY, AND DATA PRIVACY RISKSCompliance with the complex and evolving laws, regulations, standards, and contractual requirements regarding privacy and data protection could require changes in our business practices and increase costs of operation; failure to comply could result in significant claims, fines, penalties, and damages.We also collect, use, and retain other sensitive, nonpublic information, such as employee social security numbers, healthcare information, and payroll information, as well as confidential, nonpublic business information.Given the nature of our businesses, we are subject to various additional federal, state, local, and foreign laws and regulations, including, without limitation, in the areas of labor, immigration, marketing and advertising, consumer protection, financial services and products, payment processing, privacy and data security, anti-competition, environmental, health and safety, insurance, and healthcare.There have been significant new or proposed regulations and/or heightened focus by the government and others in some of these areas, including, for example, related to privacy and data security, climate change, interchange fees, consumer financial services and products, endorsements and testimonials, telemarketing, restrictive covenants, and labor, including overtime and exemption regulations, state and local laws on minimum wage, worker classification, and other labor-related issues.Even if we have sufficient resources to pay dividends and to repurchase shares of our common stock, our Board of Directors may determine to use such resources to fund other Company initiatives.The recast income statement was derived as follows: FINANCIAL OVERVIEW-YEAR ENDED JUNE 30, 2022 COMPARED TO YEAR ENDED JUNE 30, On March 21, 2020, the federal tax filing deadline in the U.
