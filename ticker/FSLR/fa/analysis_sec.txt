• During the three months ended March 31, 2023, we commenced commercial production of Series 7 modules at our third facility in Ohio, bringing our total installed nameplate module production capacity across all our Series 6 and Series 7 facilities to approximately 13 GWDC.During the three months ended March 31, 2023, we produced 2.5 GWDC and sold 1.9 GWDC of solar modules.As of March 31, 2023, our module collection and recycling liability was $130.3 million.As of March 31, 2023, we had $2.3 billion in cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities compared to $2.6 billion as of December 31, 2022.As of March 31, 2023, $1.4 billion of our cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities was held by our foreign subsidiaries and was primarily based in U. S. dollar, Indian rupee, and Euro denominated holdings.In addition to these technological advantages, we also warrant that our solar modules will produce at least 98% of their labeled power output rating during the first year, with the warranty coverage reducing by a degradation factor between 0.3% and 0.5%, depending on the module series, every year thereafter throughout the limited power output warranty period of up to 30 years.See Item 1A.“ Risk Factors” of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2022 for discussions of other risks (the“ Risk Factors”) that may affect us.For a description of the accounting policies that require the most significant judgment and estimates in the preparation of our condensed consolidated financial statements, refer to our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2022.Such pending guidance is described in Item 1A.“ Risk Factors” of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2022.For more information about certain risks associated with the benefits available to us under the IRA, see Item 1A.“ Risk Factors” of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2022.The PLI scheme is expected to provide aggregate funding of INR 185 billion ($2.3 billion), of which INR 11.8 billion ($143 million) was allocated to First Solar, to promote the manufacturing of high efficiency solar modules in India and to reduce India’ s dependency on foreign imports of solar modules.The increase in cost of sales was driven by an $86.0 million increase in our modules segment cost of sales primarily due to higher costs of $163.6 million from an increase in the volume of modules sold and higher under-utilization charges associated with the initial ramp of our first Series 7 manufacturing facility in Ohio, which increased cost of sales by $18.9 million, partially offset by our initial recognition of the advanced manufacturing production credit under Section 45X of the IRC, which decreased cost of sales by $70.1 million, and continued module cost reductions, which decreased cost of sales by $32.6 million.In January 2022, we completed the sale of our Chilean O & M operations to a subsidiary of Clairvest for consideration of $1.9 million.As a result of this transaction, we recognized a gain of $1.9 million, net of transaction costs and post-closing adjustments, during the three months ended March 31, 2022.We continue to invest significant financial resources in such initiatives, including approximately $0.4 billion for a dedicated R & D facility in the United States to support the implementation of our technology roadmap.As of March 31, 2023, such funds were comprised of restricted marketable securities of $196.6 million and restricted cash and cash equivalents balances of $2.6 million.
