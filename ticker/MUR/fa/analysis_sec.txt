These factors include: • the occurrence or threat of epidemics or pandemics, such as the outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), or any government response to such occurrence or threat which may lower the demand for hydrocarbon fuels; • worldwide and domestic supplies of, and demand for, crude oil, natural gas liquids and natural gas; • the ability of the members of OPEC and certain non-OPEC members, for example, Russia, to agree to maintain or adjust production levels; • the production levels of non-OPEC countries, including, amongst others, production levels in the shale plays in the United States; • political instability or armed conflict in oil and natural gas producing regions, such as the Russia-Ukraine conflict; • the level of drilling, completion and production activities by other exploration and production companies, and variability therein, in response to market conditions; • changes in weather patterns and climate, including those that may result from climate change; • natural disasters such as hurricanes and tornadoes, including those that may result from climate change; • the price, availability and the demand for and of alternative and competing forms of energy, such as nuclear, hydroelectric, wind or solar; • the effect of conservation efforts and focus on climate-change; • technological advances affecting energy consumption and energy supply; • increased activism against, or change in public sentiment for, oil and gas exploration, development, and production activities and considerations including climate change and the transition to a lower carbon economy; • domestic and foreign governmental regulations and taxes, including further legislation requiring, subsidizing or providing tax benefits for the use or generation of alternative energy sources and fuels; and • general economic conditions worldwide, including inflationary conditions and related governmental policies and interventions.See Note L for additional information on the derivative instruments used to manage certain risks related to commodity prices.See Note L for additional information on the derivative instruments used to manage certain risks related to commodity prices.Murphy’ s actual future oil and natural gas production may vary substantially from its reported quantity of proved reserves due to a number of factors, including: • Oil and natural gas prices which are materially different from prices used to compute proved reserves; • Operating and/or capital costs which are materially different from those assumed to compute proved reserves; • Future reservoir performance which is materially different from models used to compute proved reserves; and • Governmental regulations or actions which materially impact operations of a field.The Company’ s operations are subject to various international, foreign, national, state, provincial and local environmental, health and safety laws, regulations, governmental actions and permit requirements, including related to the generation, storage, handling, use, disposal and remediation of petroleum products, wastewater and hazardous materials; the emission and discharge of such materials to the environment, including GHG emissions; wildlife, habitat and water protection; the placement, operation and decommissioning of production equipment; the health and safety of our employees, contractors and communities where our operations are located, including indigenous communities; and the causes and impacts of climate change.These risks include underground migration or surface spillage due to releases of oil, 19 Table of ContentsPART IItem 1A.Risk Factors-ContinuedThe Company is exposed to credit risks associated with (i) sales of certain of its products to customers, (ii) joint venture partners and (iii) other counterparties.Murphy is exposed to credit risk in three principle areas: • Accounts receivable credit risk from selling its produced commodity to customers; • Joint venture partners related to certain oil and natural gas properties operated by the Company.To mitigate these risks the Company: • Actively monitors the credit worthiness of all its customers, joint venture partners and forward commodity hedge counterparties; and • Given the inherent credit risks in a cyclical commodity price business, the Company has increased the focus on its review of joint venture partners, the magnitude of potential exposure and planning suitable actions should a joint venture partner fail to pay its share of capital and operating expenditures.In March 2022, the SEC proposed rules requiring disclosure of a range of climate change-related information, including, among other things, companies’ climate change risk management; short-medium-and long-term climate-related financial risks; and disclosure of Scope 1, Scope 2 and (for certain companies) Scope 3 emissions.Risk Factors-Continuedcommon crude oil indices used to price the Company’ s crude include Mars, WTI Houston (MEH), Heavy Louisiana Sweet (HLS) and Brent.Lower oil and natural gas prices adversely affect the Company in several ways: • Lower sales value for the Company’ s oil and natural gas production reduces cash flows and net income.Although the Company maintains insurance for such risks as described elsewhere in this Form 10-K report, due to policy deductibles and possible coverage limits, weather-related risks to our operations are not fully insured.The Company’ s onshore North America oil and natural gas production is dependent on a technique known as hydraulic fracturing whereby water, sand and certain chemicals are injected into deep oil and natural gas bearing reservoirs in North America.In addition, various executive orders by the current presidential administration and the Department of Interior over the course of 2021 regarding a temporary suspension of normal-course issuance of permits for fossil fuel development on federal lands and a pause on new oil and gas leases on public lands and offshore waters, and the Secretary of Interior’ s related review of permitting and leasing practices, could adversely impact Murphy’ s operations.While the Company has been named a co-defendant with other oil and gas companies in lawsuits related to climate change, these lawsuits have not resulted in, and are not currently expected to result in, material liability for the Company.Murphy partially manages this risk through borrowing at fixed rates wherever possible; however, rates when refinancing or raising new capital are determined by factors outside of the Company’ s control.Given the increasing global threats from cybercrime, the Company’ s approach to mitigate cybersecurity risk focuses on three key elements: • People-Security awareness education and readiness-testing throughout the year for employees and contractors; • Process-Incorporating“ cyber awareness” in our day to day processes and maturing key controls such as recurring internal and external cyber risk assessments, physical and digital asset protection, and security vulnerability remediation via preventative and detective measures; and • Technology-Investing in industry aligned security technology and threat intelligence capabilities.Most recently, in November 2022, the international community gathered in Egypt at the 27 th Conference of the Parties on the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change (COP27), during which multiple announcements were made, including the EPA’ s announcement of more stringent revisions to previously proposed methane emissions rules for the oil and gas sector.WTI average price for 2022 increased 39% over the prior year principally as a result of demand recovery from the COVID-19 pandemic, geopolitical uncertainty and market disruption following the Russia/Ukraine conflict and market concerns over supply shortfalls as discussed above.However, from time to time, Murphy will seek to enter new commitments, exercise options to extend contracts and retender contracts for rigs and other industry services which could expose Murphy to the impact of higher costs.Murphy continues to strive toward safely executing our work in an ever-increasing efficient manner to mitigate possible inflationary pressures in our business.The Company has entered into agreements to lease production facilities for various producing oil fields as well as other arrangements that require future payments as described in the following section.Material off-balance sheet arrangements–Certain U. S. transportation contracts require minimum monthly payments through 2045, while onshore Canada processing contracts call for minimum monthly payments through 2051.Also presented below is adjusted EBITDA per barrel of oil equivalent sold.Adjusted EBITDA per barrel of oil equivalent sold is a non-GAAP financial metric.The decrease in per-unit production 36 Table of ContentsPART IIItem 7.Capital expenditures are discussed above in the‘ Cash Used for Investing Activities’ section.Discount rates are based on the universe of high-quality corporate bonds that are available within each country.2 Details of the capital allocation framework can be found as part of the Company’ s Form 8-K filed on August 4, 2022.Murphy’ s continuing operations generate revenue by producing crude oil, natural gas liquids (NGL) and natural gas in the United States and Canada and then selling these products to customers.The most common crude oil indices used to price the Company’ s crude include Mars, WTI Houston (MEH), Heavy Louisiana Sweet (HLS) and Brent.The 2022 NYMEX natural gas price was higher compared to 2021 and NYMEX prices in 2023 have thus far been below the comparable period in 2022.Results were favorable $1,851.6 million in 2021 compared to 2020 primarily due to higher oil, natural gas liquid and natural gas prices, significantly lower impairment charges, lower DD & A, lower LOE, lower exploration expenses and lower general and administrative (G & A) expenses, partially offset by higher transportation, gathering and processing and income tax charges.Management’ s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations-Continuedcosts in 2021 was primarily attributable to reduced costs associated with well workovers and concerted efficiency efforts.The impairment charge in 2020 was primarily the result of lower forecast future prices as of March 31, 2020, as a result of lower oil demand (COVID-19 impact) and abundant oil supply at the time of the assessment.Higher revenues were primarily due to higher realized prices (oil and condensate, natural gas and NGLs) year over year, partially offset by lower sales volume (7,514 barrels of oil equivalent per day lower) as a result of lower capital expenditures in 2020.Higher revenue was primarily attributable to higher natural gas prices and volumes at Tupper Montney and higher oil prices at Hibernia and Kaybob Duvernay.Management’ s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations-ContinuedCost per equivalent barrel sold for these production-related expenses are shown by geographical area in the following table.Management’ s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations-ContinuedCorporate 2022 vs 2021 Corporate activities, which include interest expense and income, foreign exchange effects, realized and unrealized gains and losses on derivative instruments (forward swaps and collars to hedge the price of oil sold) and corporate overhead not allocated to Exploration and Production, reported a loss of $438.3 million in 2022 compared to a loss of $668.0 million in 2021.Lower restructuring charges and G & A were due to the 2020 cost reduction efforts which included closing the Company’ s previous headquarters office in El Dorado, Arkansas, its office in Calgary, Alberta and consolidating all worldwide staff activities to its existing office location in Houston, Texas.Management’ s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations-ContinuedProduction Volumes and Prices 2022 vs 2021 Total hydrocarbon production from all E & P continuing operations averaged 175,156 barrels of oil equivalent per day in 2022, and represents a 5% increase from the 167,356 barrels per day produced in 2021.The increase is principally due to the Khaleesi, Mormont, Samurai field development project that started production in the second quarter of 2022, new wells at Tupper Montney and lower weather related downtime in 2022.NGL prices are higher in Canada due to the higher value of product produced at the Kaybob Duvernay and Placid Montney assets.The decrease of 8,261 barrels per day was principally due to lower volumes in the Gulf of Mexico (2,703 barrels per day primarily due to reservoir decline), lower volumes at Kaybob Duvernay (2,272 barrels per day due to well decline) and lower Eagle Ford Shale production (765 barrels per day).NGL prices were higher in Canada due to the higher value of product produced at the Kaybob Duvernay and Placid Montney assets.The increase of 13 MMCFD was a primarily the result of higher volumes in Canada due to bringing online 14 new wells at Tupper Montney in 2021.Management’ s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations-ContinuedThe following table contains hydrocarbons produced during the three years ended December 31, 2022.Management’ s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations-ContinuedThe following table contains hydrocarbons sold during the three years ended December 31, 2022.Management’ s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations-Continued 1 Certain prior-period amounts have been reclassified to conform to the current period presentation.Lower accounts payable is primarily due to the decrease in unrealized losses on derivative instruments (commodity price swaps and collars) which matured at the end of 2022, partially offset by higher revenue payables principally due to higher crude oil and natural gas pricing and higher trades payable related to timing of Gulf of Mexico activities.Climate Change and EmissionsThe world’ s population and standard of living is growing steadily along with the demand for energy.Natural gas demand is also impacted by demand driven by lower carbon emission and a view that natural gas is one option to transition from higher carbon emitting fuels.Although the Company’ s engineers are knowledgeable of and follow the guidelines for reserves as established by the SEC, the estimation of reserves requires the engineers to make a significant number of assumptions based on professional judgment.Murphy’ s estimations for proved reserves were generated through the integration of available geoscience, engineering, and economic data (including hydrocarbon prices, operating costs, and development costs), and commercially available technologies, to establish‘ reasonable certainty’ of economic producibility.Management’ s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations-ContinuedProperty, Plant and Equipment-impairment of long-lived assets–The Company continually monitors its long-lived assets recorded in“ Property, plant and equipment” in the Consolidated Balance Sheet to make sure that they are fairly presented.Management’ s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations-ContinuedOutlookPrices for the Company’ s primary products are often volatile.Details of the framework can be found in the“ Capital Allocation Framework” section of the Company’ s Form 8-K filed on August 4, 2022.
