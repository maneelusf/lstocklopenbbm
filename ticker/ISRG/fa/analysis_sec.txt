We are unable to predict the impact of efforts by central banks and federal, state, and local governments to combat elevated levels of inflation.In addition, in early 2023, the U. S. Government reached its existing statutory limit on the amount of permissible federal debt, and this limit must be raised in order for the U. S. Government to continue to pay its obligations on a timely basis.The costs to us to eliminate or alleviate network security problems, bugs, viruses, worms, ransomware and other 46 malicious software programs, and security vulnerabilities could be significant.Moreover, if a security breach affects our systems or results in the unauthorized release of personal information, our reputation and brand could be materially damaged, and use of our products and services could decrease.Any attempts by cyber-attackers to disrupt our services or information technology systems or the services or information technology systems of our third-party service providers, strategic partners, and other contractors or consultants, if successful, could harm our business, result in the misappropriation of funds, be expensive to remedy, and damage our reputation or brand.RISKS RELATING TO OUR BUSINESSMACROECONOMIC CONDITIONS COULD HAVE A MATERIALLY ADVERSE IMPACT ON OUR BUSINESS, FINANCIAL CONDITION, OR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS. Macroeconomic conditions, such as high inflation, changes to monetary policy, increasing interest rates, volatile currency exchange rates, credit and sovereign debt concerns in certain European countries, concerns about slowed growth in China and other OUS markets, decreasing consumer confidence and spending, including capital spending, concerns about the stability and liquidity of certain financial institutions, and global or local recessions can adversely impact demand for our products, which could negatively impact our business, financial condition, or results of operations.Globally, attacks are expected to continue accelerating in both frequency and sophistication with increasing use of tools and techniques that are designed to circumvent controls, avoid detection, and remove or obfuscate forensic evidence, all of which hinders our ability to identify, investigate, and recover from incidents.These risks and uncertainties include, among other things, uncertainties inherent in research and development; uncertainties regarding the ability of Intuitive Ventures to identify investment candidates; uncertainties regarding the success of Intuitive Ventures’ investments; uncertainties and variables inherent in the operating and financial performance in investments made, including, among other things, competitive developments and general economic, political, business, industry, regulatory and market conditions; future exchange and interest rates; and changes in tax and other laws, regulations, rates and policies.Statements using words such as“ estimates,”“ projects,”“ believes,”“ anticipates,”“ plans,”“ expects,”“ intends,”“ may,”“ will,”“ could,”“ should,”“ would,”“ targeted,” and similar words and expressions are intended to identify forward-looking statements.We saw strong procedure growth in Japan, Germany, and the UK during the first quarter of 2023.In this equation, procedure efficacy is defined as a measure of the success of the surgery in resolving the underlying disease, and invasiveness is defined as a measure of patient pain and disruption of regular activities.Similarly, the adoption of robotic-assisted bronchoscopy using the Ion system has the potential to grow if it can offer greater patient value than non-Ion alternatives and competitive total economics for healthcare providers.The first quarter 2023 procedure growth was largely attributable to growth in U. S. general surgery, OUS urology, U. S. gynecology, and OUS general surgery. U. S. Procedures.The first quarter 2023 U. S. procedure growth was largely attributable to growth in general surgery procedures, most notably hernia repair, cholecystectomy, and bariatric procedures.• Utilization of da Vinci Surgical Systems, measured in terms of procedures per system per year, increased 13% relative to the first quarter of 2022.The first quarter 2023 U. S. da Vinci procedure growth was approximately 26%, driven by growth in general surgery procedures, most notably hernia repair, cholecystectomy, and bariatric procedures, as well as moderate growth in the more mature gynecologic and urologic procedure categories.Both growth rates were impacted by the disruption caused by the COVID-19 pandemic 37 in the three months ended March 31, 2022, as noted in the COVID-19 Pandemic section above.Our actual results may differ materially and adversely from those expressed in any forward-looking statement, and we undertake no obligation to publicly update or release any revisions to these forward-looking statements, except as required by law.At the same time, governments strain to cover the healthcare needs of their populations and demand lower total cost per patient to treat disease.However, in the event of failure of any of the financial institutions where we maintain our cash and cash equivalents, there can be no assurance that we would be able to access uninsured funds in a timely manner or at all.The installed base of da Vinci Surgical Systems grew 12% to approximately 7,544 as of December 31, 2022; 12% to approximately 6,730 as of December 31, 2021; and 7% to approximately 5,989 as of December 31, 2020.Moreover, usage-based arrangements generally contain no minimum payments; therefore, customers may exit such arrangements without paying a financial penalty to us.As of March 31, 2023, we have sold 192 da Vinci Surgical Systems under this quota, and we believe that four system quotas are no longer available; therefore, 29 surgical robots should still be available for sale under this quota.Given the reimbursement level and laparoscopic penetration for these additional procedures, there can be no assurance that the adoption pace for these procedures will be similar to prostatectomy or partial nephrectomy, given their higher reimbursement, or any other da Vinci procedure.The discussion of indications for use and representative or target procedures is intended solely to provide an understanding of the market for our products and is not intended to promote for sale or use any Intuitive product outside of its licensed or cleared labeling and indications for use.Not all indications, procedures, or products described may be available in a given country or region or on all generations of da Vinci Surgical Systems.Revenue generated in the U. S. accounted for 65% of total revenue for both of the three months ended March 31, 2023, and March 31, 2022.
