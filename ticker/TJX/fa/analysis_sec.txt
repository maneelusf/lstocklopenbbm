Our growth strategy includes successfully expanding within our current markets and/or into new geographic regions, product lines and channels, including e-commerce, and, as appropriate, adding new businesses, whether by development, investment or acquisition.We must constantly recruit new Associates to fill entry level and part-time positions with high rates of turnover and at times find seasonal talent in sufficient numbers.19 Additionally, we routinely enter into inventory-related derivative instruments (a hedging strategy) to mitigate the impact of currency exchange rates on merchandise margins resulting from merchandise purchases by our segments denominated in currencies other than their local currencies.Tax matters could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.Failure to continue to expand our business successfully could adversely affect our financial results.We are subject to various risks of sourcing merchandise, particularly from other countries, including risks related to moving merchandise internationally.Any of these risks could adversely impact our operations, profitability or liquidity.We expect that currency exchange rate fluctuations could have a material adverse effect on our sales and results of operations from time to time.Meeting these expectations effectively generally involves identifying the right opportunities and making the right investments at the right time and with the right speed, among other things, and failure to do so may impact our financial results.These conditions could have a continuing impact on consumer spending, the way our Associates work, or our company culture and could have adverse effects on our business, financial condition and results of operations.Changes in the capital and credit markets, including market disruptions, limited liquidity and interest rate fluctuations, have in the past, and may continue to, increase the cost of financing or restrict our access to these potential sources of liquidity.Our continued access to these liquidity sources on favorable terms depends on multiple factors, including our operating performance, and maintaining strong credit ratings.Failure to execute on mergers, acquisitions, investments, divestitures, closings and consolidations in a satisfactory manner, including due to circumstances outside our control, could adversely affect our future results of operations and financial condition.Although we believe our flexible off-price model helps us react to such changes, shifts in the market may adversely affect our sales, cash flows, merchandise orders and results of operations and performance.Quality, safety or other issues with merchandise we buy and sell could impact our reputation, sales and financial results.The terms“ segment margin” or“ segment profit margin” are used to describe segment profit or loss as a percentage of net sales.S.
