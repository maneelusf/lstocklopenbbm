S. In May 2020, the WarnerMedia Business launched HBO Max in the U. S. We have incurred and will likely continue to incur significant costs to develop and market discovery + and HBO Max, including costs related to developing and implementing a go-to-market strategy that coordinates and/or combines our DTC products, and there can be no assurance that consumers and advertisers will embrace our offerings or that subscribers will activate or renew a subscription.During the three months ended March 31, 2022, we exited our operations in Russia and removed all of our channels and services from the market.Depreciation and amortization decreased $214 million and $429 million, respectively, primarily attributable to a change in amortization method from the straight-line method to the sum of the years'digits method for some of the WM assets acquired.Theatrical performance was unfavorably impacted by the timing of releases, and home entertainment across theatrical and television product was lower due to strong COVID-induced demand in the prior year quarter.In conjunction with the Merger, the Company reevaluated and changed its segment presentation and reportable segments for the quarter ending June 30, 2022.43 RESULTS OF OPERATIONSThe discussion below compares our actual and pro forma combined results, as if the Merger occurred on January 1, 2021, for the three and six months ended June 30, 2022 to the three and six months ended June 30, 2021.Actual amounts for the three and six months ended June 30, 2022 include results of operations for Discovery for the entire period and WM for the period subsequent to the completion of the Merger on April 8, 2022.Advertising revenue increased 5% and 4% for the three and six months ended June 30, 2022, respectively, primarily attributable to increased sports advertising in the U. S., the launch of the HBO Max ad-supported tier product in June 2021, and subscriber growth at discovery + ad-lite tier, partially offset by lower news, kids, and general entertainment performance in the U. S. Distribution revenue consists principally of fees from affiliates for distributing our linear networks and DTC subscription services.The decrease for the three months ended June 30, 2022 is primarily attributable to the proportion of inter-segment licensing increasing as a percentage of total content revenue.The increase for the six months ended June 30, 2022 is primarily attributable to higher third party international licensing of sports rights.Selling, general, and administrative expenses increased for the three months ended June 30, 2022, primarily attributable to increased third-party transaction and integration costs related to the Merger and share-based compensation.Loss (Gain) on DispositionGain on disposition was $72 million for the three and six months ended June 30, 2021, and was primarily attributable to the sale of our Great American Country network.The decrease is partially offset by the unfavorable tax adjustment related to the preferred stock conversion transaction expense discussed in Note 2 recorded in the three months ended June 30, 2022 that was not deductible for tax purposes and a deferred tax benefit of $162 million recorded in the three months ended June 30, 2021 as a result of the UK Finance Act 2021 that was enacted in June 2021.The increase for the three months ended June 30, 2022 was primarily attributable to higher games revenue with the release of LEGO Star Wars-The Skywalker Saga, partially offset by lower TV licensing, home entertainment and theatrical rental revenue.The increase for the six months ended June 30, 2022 was primarily attributable to higher theatrical film rental revenue and TV licensing revenue, partly offset by lower home entertainment revenue.The increase for the three and six months ended June 30, 2022 was primarily attributable to increased studio operations revenues from the reopening of Warner Bros.The increase for the three and six months ended June 30, 2022 was primarily attributable to higher games and theatrical content expense, partially offset by lower content expense for television products.RevenuesAdvertising revenue increased 2% for the three and six months ended June 30, 2022, primarily attributable to increased sports advertising in the U. S., partially offset by lower news, kids, and general entertainment in the U. S. International networks were, in part, impacted by the sale of Chilevisión in September 2021.The increase for the three months ended June 30, 2022 was primarily attributable to higher inter-segment licensing of digital content.The increase for the six months ended June 30, 2022 was primarily attributable to higher third party international licensing of sports rights, mainly related to Olympic sports rights to broadcast networks throughout Europe.The increase for the three and six months ended June 30, 2022 was primarily attributable to higher sports rights and content expense.54 Selling, General and AdministrativeSelling, general and administrative expenses were flat for the three months ended June 30, 2022, as higher marketing expenses were offset by cost synergies, and increased 2% for the six months ended June 30, 2022, primarily attributable to higher marketing offset by cost synergies.56 Costs of RevenuesCosts of revenues increased 33% and 34% for the three and six months ended June 30, 2022, respectively, primarily attributable to increased investments in programming expenses to support existing platforms and new market launches.The decrease for the three months ended June 30, 2022 was primarily attributable to more efficient and measured marketing-related spend to support discovery + and HBO Max.As reported transaction and integration costs for the three and six months ended June 30, 2022 included the impact of the issuance of additional shares of common stock to Advance/Newhouse Programming Partnership of $789 million upon the closing of the Merger.As of June 30, 2022, we also have a $6.0 billion revolving credit facility and a $1.5 billion commercial paper program, as described below.The Credit Facility will be available on a revolving basis until June 2026, with an option for up to two additional 364-day renewal periods subject to the lenders'consent.• Redeemable Noncontrolling Interest and Noncontrolling InterestDue to business combinations, we have redeemable equity balances of $328 million at June 30, 2022, which may require the use of cash in the event holders of noncontrolling interests put their interests to us.In February 2020, our Board of Directors authorized additional stock repurchases of up to $2 billion upon completion of our existing $1 billion repurchase authorization announced in May 2019.The increase in cash used in financing activities was primarily attributable to principal repayments made on our term loans and senior notes and an increase in distributions to noncontrolling interests and redeemable noncontrolling interests during the six months ended June 30, 2022.As of June 30, 2022, we held $1.2 billion of our $2.6 billion of cash and cash equivalents in our foreign subsidiaries.The summarized income statement information for the six months ended June 30, 2022 includes information with respect to WarnerMedia Holdings, Inc. beginning subsequent to the close of the Merger.
