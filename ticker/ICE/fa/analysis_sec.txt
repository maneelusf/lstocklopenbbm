Many of those jurisdictions have passed data privacy legislation, with many more contemplating new laws.Effective succession planning is also important to our long-term success.We also face pricing competition in many areas of our business.• We may be at greater risk from terrorism, including cyberterrorism, than other companies.• After the completion of the merger, we will be more leveraged than we currently are, and the financing arrangements that we will enter into will contain restrictions and limitations that could, under certain circumstances, have a material adverse effect on our business and operations.For example, clearing members in ICE Clear Europe have provided margin and guaranty funds with an aggregate cash balance of $105.4 billion as of December 31, 2022 and a total of $147.4 billion for all of our clearing houses as of December 31, 2022.We may be at greater risk from terrorism, including cyberterrorism, than other companies.As of December 31, 2022, we had goodwill of $21.1 billion and net other intangible assets of $13.1 billion relating to our acquisitions and our purchase of trademarks and Internet domain names from various third parties.It may take longer than expected for us to realize the expected returns from this investment or such returns may ultimately be less than anticipated.Some of our competitors may have greater capital and resources, offer a wide range of products and services or operate under less stringent regulatory regimes than we do.After the completion of the merger, we will be more leveraged than we currently are, and the financing arrangements that we will enter into will contain restrictions and limitations that could, under certain circumstances, have a material adverse effect on our business and operations.On February 2, 2023, we announced a $0.42 per share dividend for the first quarter of 2023 payable on March 31, 2023 to stockholders of record as of March 17, 2023.Our goodwill and other indefinite-lived intangible assets are evaluated for impairment annually in our fiscal fourth quarter or more frequently if conditions exist that indicate that the value may be impaired.We test our goodwill for impairment at the reporting unit level, and we have identified four reporting units.These impairment evaluations are performed by comparing the carrying value of the goodwill or other indefinite-lived intangibles to its estimated fair value.For our goodwill impairment testing, we have elected to bypass the qualitative assessment and apply the quantitative approach.Application of the impairment test requires judgment, including the identification of reporting units, assignment of assets and liabilities to reporting units, assignment of goodwill to reporting units, and determination of the fair value of each reporting unit.Our actual results could differ materially from those anticipated in these forward-looking statements for many reasons.Our business has been impacted positively and negatively by these global economic conditions.–Other agricultural and metal futures and options volumes increased 4% in 2022 from 2021.Other revenues include professional services fees, as well as revenues from ancillary products.The performance-based restricted stock compensation expense is also based on our financial performance.Technology and communications expense also includes fees paid for access to external market data, licensing and other fee agreement expenses.This expense includes amortization of intangible assets obtained in our acquisitions of businesses, as well as on various licensing agreements, over their estimated useful lives.This expense also includes amortization of internally-developed and purchased software over its estimated useful life.In 2022, these adjustments also include the gain on the sale of our Euroclear investment and the net losses and impairment of our unconsolidated investees.During 2021, these adjustments also included the gains on the sale of our Coinbase investment and our deconsolidation of Bakkt.We have other purchase obligations to purchase various goods and services that we believe are enforceable and legally binding.
