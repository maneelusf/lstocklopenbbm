Price, product and geographic mix had an 11 percent favorable impact on our consolidated net operating revenues.Gross Profit MarginGross profit margin is a ratio calculated by dividing gross profit by net operating revenues.These favorable impacts were offset by the impact of higher commodity costs and an unfavorable foreign currency exchange rate impact of 1 percent.Risk Factors” in Part I and“ Our Business—Challenges and Risks” in Part II of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2022.The favorable channel and package mix in all applicable operating segments was primarily a result of the continued recovery from the COVID-19 pandemic in away-from-home channels in many markets in the current year.As a result, the first quarter of 2023 had one less day when compared to the first quarter of 2022, and the fourth quarter of 2023 will have one additional day when compared to the fourth quarter of 2022.As a result of the timing of our quarterly reporting periods as well as our dividend payment dates, the Company paid substantially all of the first quarterly dividend of 2023 in the second quarter and paid all of the first quarterly dividend of 2022 in the first quarter.The increase was primarily due to increased marketing spending and operating expenses, partially offset by a decrease in stock-based compensation expense.The decrease was driven by an unfavorable foreign currency exchange rate impact; higher other operating charges; and higher selling, general and administrative expenses.As a result, management must make numerous assumptions, which involve a significant amount of judgment, when performing recoverability and impairment tests of current and noncurrent assets in various regions around the world.For other assets, impairment tests are required at least annually, or more frequently if events or circumstances indicate that an asset may be impaired.The variability of these factors depends on a number of conditions, and thus our accounting estimates may change from period to period.These factors are even more difficult to estimate as a result of uncertainties associated with the scope, severity and duration of the COVID-19 pandemic.If we had used other assumptions and estimates when impairment tests were performed, impairment charges could have resulted.Furthermore, if management uses different assumptions in future periods, or if different conditions exist in future periods, impairment charges could result.The total future impairment charges we may be required to record could be material.However, the actual amount we record with respect to our proportionate share of such charge may be impacted by items such as basis differences, deferred taxes and deferred gains.The increase reflects, among other items, the impact of more favorable operating results reported by some of our equity method investees in the current year, partially offset by an $87 million increase in net charges resulting from the Company’ s proportionate share of significant operating and nonoperating items recorded by certain of our equity method investees.The Company recognized a net gain of $113 million related to realized and unrealized gains and losses on equity securities and trading debt securities as well as realized gains and losses on available-for-sale debt securities, and recognized net foreign currency exchange losses of $24 million.Additionally, other income (loss)—net included income of $13 million related to the non-service cost components of net periodic benefit cost and dividend income of $66 million.The Company recognized a net loss of $104 million related to realized and unrealized gains and losses on equity securities and trading debt securities as well as realized gains and losses on available-for-sale debt securities, net foreign currency exchange losses of $73 million and a net loss of $24 million as a result of one of our equity method investees issuing additional shares of its stock.Additionally, other income (loss)—net included income of $70 million related to the non-service cost components of net periodic benefit income and dividend income of $12 million.Additional income tax and interest would continue to accrue until the time any such potential liability, or portion thereof, were to be paid.
