Please see the section entitled“ The Agreement and Plan of Merger-Conditions to the Merger” in the Proxy Statement.During fiscal years 2020 and 2019, we had $6.4 billion and $8.0 billion of net client outflows, respectively, primarily in equity assets in fiscal year 2020 and primarily in equity and fixed income in fiscal year 2019.We earned $99.0 million, $84.9 million and $227.8 million in performance fees during fiscal years 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively.Risks Related to our CompanyOur Leverage May Affect our Business and May Restrict our Operating ResultsAt March 31, 2020, on a consolidated basis, we had approximately $2.0 billion in total indebtedness, and total stockholders'equity of $3.8 billion, and our goodwill and other intangible assets were $1.8 billion and $3.4 billion, respectively.As of March 31, 2020, our right-of-use (“ ROU”) assets with commitments from third parties under non-cancellable subleases were approximately $72 million.For example, during the quarter ended December 31, 2018, we incurred $365.2 million of aggregate impairment charges.These impairment charges were comprised of $274.6 million and $18.2 million associated with our combined EnTrust Global indefinite-life fund management contracts asset and trade name asset, respectively, and $65.0 million, $6.4 million, and $1.0 million, associated with our RARE Infrastructure indefinite-life fund management contracts asset, amortizable fund management contracts asset, and trade name asset, respectively.A majority of the directors of each mutual fund are independent from us.Performance-Based Fee Arrangements May Increase the Volatility of our RevenuesA portion of our total revenues is derived from performance fees.Of the $99.0 million in performance fees earned during fiscal year 2020, $42.0 million was passed through to the Clarion Partners management team.If the Merger Agreement is terminated and a party’ s board of directors seeks another merger or business combination, our stockholders cannot be certain that we will be able to find a party willing to engage in a transaction on more attractive terms than the Merger.Our AUM can generate very different revenues per dollar of managed assets based on factors such as the type of asset managed (alternative assets and equity assets generally produce greater revenues than fixed income assets), the type of client (institutional clients generally pay lower fees than other clients), the type of asset management product or service provided and the fee schedule of the asset manager providing the service.In addition, our asset managers are not typically the lowest cost provider of asset management services.As of October 31, 2019, the date of our most recent annual impairment testing, the implied fair value of our Global Asset Management reporting unit exceeded its carry value of $1.9 billion by 22%.Under the relevant Code provisions, an“ ownership change” occurs if there is a cumulative net increase in the aggregate ownership of our common stock by“ 5% shareholders” (as defined in the Code) of more than 50 percent of the total outstanding shares of our common stock during a rolling three-year period.Additionally, new assessments were issued for the 31 Table of Contentsyears 2011 through 2014 and the net amount at issue in those years is over $18 million (97 million BRL).We achieved $68 million of savings from the strategic restructuring during the year ended March 31, 2020, for cumulative achieved savings of $72 million since January 1, 2019.A decrease in our operating revenue yield to 38 basis points for the year ended March 31, 2019, from 39 basis points for the year ended March 31, 2018, also contributed to the decrease.Distribution and Service FeesFor the year ended March 31, 2020, Distribution and service fees decreased $32.6 million, or 11%, to $270.4 million, as compared to $303.0 million for the year ended March 31, 2019, reflecting a reduction in average mutual fund AUM subject to distribution and service fees and a shift in average AUM subject to distribution and service fees to lower fee share classes, as previously discussed.For the year ended March 31, 2019, Distribution and service fees decreased $18.9 million, or 6%, to $303.0 million, as compared to $321.9 million for the year ended March 31, 2018, primarily due to a reduction in
