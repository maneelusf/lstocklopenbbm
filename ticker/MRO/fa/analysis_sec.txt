These factors include: • worldwide and domestic supplies of and demand for crude oil and condensate, NGLs and natural gas; • the cost of exploring for, developing and producing crude oil and condensate, NGLs and natural gas; • the ability of the members of OPEC and certain non-OPEC members, such as Russia, to agree to and maintain production controls; • the production levels of non-OPEC countries, including production levels in the shale plays in the United States; • the level of drilling, completion and production activities by other exploration and production companies, and variability therein, in response to market conditions; • political instability or armed conflict in oil and natural gas producing regions; • changes in weather patterns and climate; • natural disasters such as hurricanes and tornadoes; • the price and availability of alternative and competing forms of energy, such as nuclear, hydroelectric, wind and solar; • the effect of conservation efforts; • epidemics or pandemics, including the ongoing novel coronavirus global pandemic, known as COVID-19; • technological advances affecting energy consumption and energy supply; • domestic and foreign governmental regulations and taxes; and • general economic conditions worldwide.Historical declines in commodity prices have adversely affected our business by: • reducing the amount of crude oil and condensate, NGLs and natural gas that we can produce economically; • reducing our revenues, operating income and cash flows; • causing us to reduce our capital expenditures, and delay or postpone some of our capital projects; • requiring us to impair the carrying value of our assets; • reducing the standardized measure of discounted future net cash flows relating to crude oil and condensate, NGLs and natural gas; and • increasing the costs of obtaining capital, such as equity and short-and long-term debt.Estimates of economically producible reserves and of future net cash flows depend on a number of variable factors and assumptions, including: • location, size and shape of the accumulation, as well as fluid, rock and producing characteristics of the accumulation; • historical production from the area, compared with production from other analogous producing areas; • the assumed impacts of regulation by governmental agencies; • assumptions concerning future operating costs, taxes, development costs and workover and repair costs; and • industry economic conditions, levels of cash flows from operations and other operating considerations.Because of the subjective nature of such reserve estimates, each of the following items may differ materially from the estimated amounts: • the amount and timing of production; • the revenues and costs associated with that production; and • the amount and timing of future development expenditures.The costs of drilling, completing and operating wells are often uncertain, and drilling operations may be curtailed, delayed or canceled as a result of a variety of factors, including: • unexpected drilling conditions; • title problems; • pressure or irregularities in formations; • equipment failures or accidents; • inflation in exploration and drilling costs; • fires, explosions, blowouts or surface cratering; • lack of, or disruption in, access to pipelines or other transportation methods; and • shortages or delays in the availability of services or delivery of equipment.Creating and maintaining an inventory of prospects for future production depends on many factors, including: • obtaining rights to explore for, develop and produce crude oil and condensate, NGLs and natural gas in promising areas; • drilling success; • the ability to complete projects timely and cost effectively; • the ability to find or acquire additional proved reserves at acceptable costs; and • the ability to fund such activity.Such delays or cost increases may arise as a result of unpredictable factors, many of which are beyond our control, including: • denial of or delay in receiving requisite regulatory approvals and/or permits; • unplanned increases in the cost of construction materials or labor; • disruptions in transportation of components or construction materials; • increased costs or operational delays resulting from shortages of water; • adverse weather conditions, natural disasters or other events (such as equipment malfunctions, explosions, fires or spills) affecting our facilities, or those of vendors or suppliers; • shortages of sufficiently skilled labor, or labor disagreements resulting in unplanned work stoppages; • market-related increases in a project’ s debt or equity financing costs; and • nonperformance by, or disputes with, vendors, suppliers, contractors or subcontractors.Financial Statements and Supplementary Data–Note 18 to the consolidated financial statements for a discussion of debt obligations.Additionally, states in which we operate may: impose additional regulations legislation, or requirements, such as the proposed Volatile Organic Compound emission rules in New Mexico; begin initiatives addressing the impact of global climate change, air emissions or water management; or we may become subject to additional regulations based on questions of sovereignty between the states and Native American tribes.COVID-19 could have a negative impact on our operations; impact the ability of our counterparties to perform their obligations; result in voluntary and involuntary curtailments, delays or cancellations of certain drilling activities; impair the quantity or value of our reserves; result in transportation and storage capacity constraints; cause shortages of key personnel, including employees, contractors and subcontractors; interrupt global supply chains; increase impairments and associated charges to our earnings; impact our cash on hand, uses of cash and cause a decrease to our financial flexibility and liquidity.In some instances, certain insurance could become unavailable or available only for reduced amounts of coverage.A revised OPEC deal to reduce production was agreed early in the second quarter of 2020 and prices partially recovered through the end of the year.In late 2020, we implemented a process for a phased return of employees to the office, and during April 2021, the majority of our corporate workforce returned to the office.In 2020, impairments consisted of a $95 million goodwill charge related to our International reporting unit and a $49 million long-lived asset impairment related to a damaged, unsalvageable well and related equipment in the Louisiana Austin Chalk.Shelf RegistrationWe have a universal shelf registration statement filed with the SEC under which we, as a“ well-known seasoned issuer” for purposes of SEC rules, have the ability to issue and sell an indeterminate amount of various types of debt and equity securities.The observed statistical nature of production performance coupled with highly certain reservoir continuity or quality and sufficient proved developed locations establish the reasonable certainty criteria required for booking proved reserves.For purposes of an impairment evaluation, long-lived assets must be grouped at the lowest level for which independent cash flows can be identified, which generally is field-by-field or, in certain instances, by logical grouping of assets if there is significant shared infrastructure or contractual terms that cause economic 47 interdependency amongst separate, discrete fields.Production expenses decreased $21 million during 2021 from 2020, primarily as a result of the U. S. segment’ s continued cost management, specifically staffing and contract labor.The increase in shipping and handling costs of these percentage-of-proceeds contracts coincides with the increase in realized natural gas liquids prices.The following table provides DD & A expense and DD & A expense rates for each segment: 39 Impairments decreased $84 million in 2021 from 2020.LeasesIn 2018, we signed an agreement with an owner/lessor to construct and lease a new build-to-suit office building in Houston, Texas.(a) Average of monthly prices obtained from the United States Energy Information Agency website.Certain of our processing arrangements with midstream entities are percentage-of-proceeds contracts.We also incurred approximately $20 million less expense related to amortization of insignificant unproved property lease balances in 2021.• Level 2–Observable market-based inputs or unobservable inputs that are corroborated by market data.The first input involves hydrocarbons produced from our Alba Field.Income TaxesWe are subject to income taxes in numerous taxing jurisdictions worldwide.
