We cannot predict how changes will affect our business operations or the cost of compliance to us, our customers or our suppliers.If we suffer a loss to our factories, facilities or distribution system due to catastrophe, our operations could be seriously harmed.On June 18, 2021, we increased the maximum amount of our commercial paper program to $1.35 billion.The life sciences industry is intensely competitive and has been subject to increasing consolidation.Intercompany transactions associated with the sale of inventory, services, intellectual property and cost share arrangements are complex and affect our tax liabilities.Any of the above circumstances could have an adverse effect on our business and operating results and financial condition.Any significant costs or liabilities could have an adverse effect on results of operations.A difference in the ultimate resolution of tax uncertainties from what is currently estimated could have an adverse effect on our financial results and condition.The ability of these manufacturers to perform is largely outside of our control.The success of our new products and services will depend on several factors, including our ability to: • properly identify customer needs and predict future needs; • innovate and develop new technologies, services and applications; • appropriately allocate our research and development spending to products and services with higher growth prospects; • successfully commercialize new technologies in a timely manner; • manufacture and deliver new products in sufficient volumes and on time; • differentiate our offerings from our competitors'offerings; • price our products competitively; • anticipate our competitors'development of new products, services or technological innovations; and • control product quality in our manufacturing process.As a result of such transactions, our financial results may differ from our own or the investment community's expectations in a given fiscal quarter or over the long term.Further, other properties we have previously owned or leased at which we have operated in the past, or for which we have otherwise contractually assumed or provided indemnities, certain actual or contingent environmental liabilities may or do require remediation.Net revenue increased in all business segments, geographic regions and most key end markets.A portion of our revenue relates to lease arrangements.Our indefinite-lived intangible assets are IPR & D intangible assets.Services and other revenue increased 16 percent in 2021 as compared to 2020.Gross margin was flat in 2022 compared to 2021.All key end markets had revenue increases when compared to 2020.Gross margin was relatively flat in 2021 when compared to 2020.Revenue for these contracts is recognized on a straight-line basis to revenue over the service period, as a time-based measure of progress best reflects our performance in satisfying this obligation.If actual market conditions are more favorable than anticipated, inventory previously written down may be sold to customers, resulting in lower cost of sales and higher income from operations than expected in that period.Services sold with instrument sales grew more than twice as fast as the growth in after-market service revenue during that same period.Gross margin increased due to higher sales volume offsetting the higher wages and logistics costs.Gross margin increased due to higher sales volume more than offsetting higher wages, variable pay, inventory charges and logistics expenses.Revenue growth also reflected weakened sales in 2020 when many of our customers closed their sites or reduced their operating capacity in response to the COVID-19 pandemic.As of October 31, 2022, the remaining $117 million included in other long-term liabilities relates to the U. S. transition tax payment which is due in installments over the next four years.
