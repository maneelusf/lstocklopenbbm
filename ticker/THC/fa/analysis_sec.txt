As a result of the aforementioned challenges, we have been, and we may continue to be, required to enhance wages and benefits to recruit and retain experienced employees, pay premiums above standard compensation for essential workers, make greater investments in education and training for newly licensed medical support personnel, or hire more expensive temporary or contract employees, which we also compete with other healthcare providers to secure.Vertical integration efforts involving third ‑ party payers and healthcare providers, among other factors, may increase competitive challenges.Furthermore, increased competition has resulted and may continue to result in pricing pressures, which could negatively impact Conifer’ s margins and growth rate.In general, our failure to successfully recruit qualified employees, manage attrition, avoid labor disruptions, control costs and plan for future labor needs could have a material adverse effect on our ability to treat patients and our overall business, financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.We monitor and routinely test our security systems and processes and have a diversified data network that provides redundancies as well as other measures designed to protect the integrity, security and availability of the data we process, transmit and store.Our networks and technology systems have also experienced disruption due to planned events, such as system implementations, upgrades, and other maintenance and improvements, and they are subject to disruption in the future for similar events, as well as catastrophic events, including a major earthquake, fire, hurricane, telecommunications failure, terrorist attack or the like.In addition, from time to time, we have been and expect to continue to be subject to regulatory proceedings and private litigation (including employee class action lawsuits) concerning our application of various federal and state labor laws, rules and regulations governing a variety of workplace wage and hour issues.Risks Related to Acquisitions, Divestitures and Joint VenturesWhen we acquire new assets or businesses, we become subject to various risks and uncertainties that could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.Furthermore, our Credit Agreement, our LC Facility and the indentures governing our outstanding notes contain, and any future debt obligations may contain, covenants that, among other things, restrict our ability to pay dividends, incur additional debt and sell assets.RISK FACTORSOur business is subject to a number of risks and uncertainties, many of which are beyond our control, that may cause our actual operating results or financial performance to be materially different from our expectations and make an investment in our securities risky.Moreover, in 2022, our commercial managed care net inpatient revenue per admission from the hospitals in our Hospital Operations segment was approximately 81% higher than our aggregate yield on a per ‑ admission basis from government payers, including managed Medicare and Medicaid insurance plans.Another major factor in the competitive position of a hospital or outpatient facility is the scope of its relationships with managed care plans given that HMOs, PPOs, third ‑ party administrators and other third ‑ party payers use managed care contracts to encourage patients to use certain hospitals in exchange for discounts from the hospitals’ established charges.Medicare requires providers to report certain quality measures in order to receive full reimbursement increases for inpatient and outpatient procedures that were previously awarded automatically; each year, CMS updates these measures through refinement or removal of existing measures and the addition of new measures.Trends affecting our actual or anticipated results may require us to record impairment and restructuring charges that may negatively impact our results of operations.In addition, we may be unable to timely and effectively integrate ASCs, physician practices and other businesses that we acquire with our ongoing operations, or we may experience delays implementing operating procedures, personnel and systems, which could impact the financial performance of the acquired business.In addition, our divestiture activities have required, and may in the future require, us to retain significant pre ‑ closing liabilities, recognize impairment charges (as discussed above) or agree to contractual restrictions that limit our ability to reenter a particular market, which may be material.We have invested in a number of joint ventures with other entities when circumstances warranted the use of these structures, and we may form additional joint ventures in the future.• Our debt service obligations reduce the amount of funds available for our operations, capital expenditures and corporate development activities, and may make it more difficult for us to satisfy our financial obligations.Our ability to make scheduled payments on or to refinance our indebtedness depends on our financial and operating performance, which is subject to prevailing economic and competitive conditions and to financial, business and other factors that may be beyond our control.Our ability to meet this financial ratio and the aforementioned restrictive covenants may be affected by events beyond our control, and we cannot assure you that we will meet those tests.Despite current indebtedness levels, we have the ability and may decide to incur substantially more debt or otherwise increase our leverage.Effective June 30, 2022, we purchased all of the shares in USPI that Baylor held on that date for $406 million, which increased our ownership interest in USPI’ s voting shares from 95% to 100%.The increase in our Ambulatory Care segment’ s total consolidated cases of 17.9% in the three months ended December 31, 2022, as compared to the same period in 2021, is primarily attributable to incremental case volume from our recently acquired ASCs.
