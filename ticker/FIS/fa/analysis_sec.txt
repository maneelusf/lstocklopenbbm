In the event a dispute between a cardholder and a merchant is not resolved in favor of the merchant, the transaction is normally charged back to the merchant, and the purchase price is credited or otherwise refunded to the cardholder and FIS is required to collect from the merchant.These effects began to accelerate in the fourth quarter of 2022 and are expected to continue to adversely affect our future financial performance.These expectations contributed to our fourth quarter 2022 goodwill impairment in our Merchant reporting unit, and further deterioration in macroeconomic conditions beyond our current expectations could contribute to further impairment.Pursuant to our annual goodwill impairment test that we began conducting in November 2022 with a quantitative analysis as of October 1, 2022, as supplemented by a further analysis measured as of December 31, 2022, we recorded a total goodwill impairment charge of $17.6 billion in the fourth quarter of 2022 for the Merchant reporting unit.In the fourth quarter of 2020, we recorded $94 million in goodwill impairment related to certain non-strategic businesses in the Corporate and Other segment.No matter how careful the design and development, complex software often contains errors and defects when first introduced and when major new updates or enhancements are released.For all other reporting units for all periods presented, goodwill was not impaired.In addition, we will incur one-time costs and ongoing costs in connection with, or as a result of, the spin-off, including costs of operating as independent, publicly traded companies that the two businesses will no longer be able to share.Accordingly, readers should not place undue reliance on these forward-looking statements.These emerging market economies tend to be more volatile than the more established markets we serve in North America and Europe, which could add volatility to our future revenue and earnings.Unfavorable resolution of tax contingencies or unfavorable future tax law changes could adversely affect our tax expense.An unfavorable outcome to a tax audit could result in higher tax expense and could negatively impact our effective tax rate, financial position, results of operations and cash flows in the current and/or future periods.In 2021, we received approximately $367 million of cash for the net proceeds from the sale of our equity ownership interest in Cardinal Holdings.The Merchant segment posted revenue growth of 6% in 2022 compared to the prior year, net of (3%) growth impact of unfavorable foreign currency movements, with a deceleration over the second half of the year, particularly in the fourth quarter.Cash flows from operations decreased $871 million in 2022 and increased $368 million in 2021.The slowing growth primarily reflects a decline in SMB sub-segment revenues, attributable to slower economic growth and competitive pressures.See Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements for a more detailed description of the significant accounting policies that have been followed in preparing our consolidated financial statements.The effective tax rate for 2021 includes the one-time net remeasurement of certain deferred tax liabilities due to the increase in the U. K. corporate statutory tax rate from 19% to 25% effective April 1, 2023, enacted on June 10, 2021.Revenue decreased primarily due to divestitures of non-strategic businesses in 2022 as well as client attrition in our non-strategic businesses.We currently expect to continue to pay quarterly dividends at a target payout ratio consistent with our previously announced capital allocation strategy.Goodwill ImpairmentThe Company assesses goodwill for impairment by reporting unit on an annual basis during the fourth quarter or more frequently if circumstances indicate potential impairment.Pursuant to our annual goodwill impairment test performed as of October 1, 2022, and supplemented by a further impairment test performed as of December 31, 2022, we recorded a total goodwill impairment charge of $17.6 billion in the fourth quarter of 2022 for the Merchant reporting unit.As a result of the assessment, the fair value of the reporting unit was estimated to be in excess of its carrying amount by approximately 4%.35 Table of ContentsThe Merchant reporting unit remained at risk for future goodwill impairment as it was reasonably possible that future developments could have a material impact on one or more of the estimates and assumptions used to evaluate goodwill impairment and could result in future goodwill impairment; accordingly, we continued to evaluate through the first three quarters of 2022 whether events and circumstances at each interim reporting date indicated a potential goodwill impairment, concluding based on our assessments that it remained more likely than not that the fair value of the Merchant reporting unit continued to exceed its carrying amount, which carrying amount had declined by approximately $3.7 billion or 9% since the 2020 quantitative assessment due to changes in foreign currency and amortization of purchased intangibles.As of December 31, 2022, the fair value of the Merchant reporting unit was estimated to be less than its carrying value, and we recorded a total goodwill impairment charge of $17.6 billion in the fourth quarter of 2022.As a result, the Merchant reporting unitâ€™ s carrying value as of December 31, 2022, is equal to its fair value, and the reporting unit is at a heightened risk of future impairment if certain assumptions and estimates were to change.
