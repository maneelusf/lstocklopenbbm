Our risk factors disclosed in Part I, Item 1A, of our Annual Report, on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2022, provide additional disclosure for these supplemental risks and are incorporated herein by reference.Business—Reimbursement, of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2022.See our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2022, Part I, Item 1A.Business—Reimbursement, of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2022.Further, additional risks not currently known to us or that we currently believe are immaterial may in the future materially and adversely affect our business, operations, liquidity and stock price.For example, despite the European Medicines Agency’ s approval of Repatha for the treatment of patients with established atherosclerotic disease, prior to 2020, the reimbursement of Repatha in France was limited to a narrower patient population (such as those with homozygous familial hypercholesterolemia (HoFH)) following a national health technology assessment.Risk Factors—Concentration of sales at certain of our wholesaler distributors and consolidation of private payers may negatively affect our business.States are also seeking to change the way they pay for drugs for patients covered by state programs.Many countries decide on reimbursement between potentially competing products through national or regional tenders that often result in one product receiving most or all of the sales in that country or region.Any of those events could cause us to record impairment charges with respect to our investment portfolio or to realize losses on sales of investments.These factors have limited, and may continue to limit, patient affordability and use, negatively affecting Repatha sales.Our business is also affected by policies implemented by private healthcare entities that process Medicare claims, including Medicare Administrative Contractors.Consequently, these and other financial pressures have caused, and may continue to cause, government or other third-party payers to more aggressively seek cost containment measures in healthcare and other settings.The global spread of COVID-19, and more recently, interest rate increases, have also led to disruption and volatility in the global capital markets.We also maintain a majority of our cash and cash equivalents in accounts with major multi-national financial institutions, and our deposits at these institutions exceed insured limits.31 ProliaTotal Prolia sales by geographic region were as follows (dollar amounts

taxesThe increase in our effective tax rate for the three months ended March 31, 2023, was primarily due to the new Puerto Rico income tax beginning in 2023 and an increase in interest expense on tax reserves.See Note 3, Acquisitions and divestitures, to the condensed consolidated financial statements.
