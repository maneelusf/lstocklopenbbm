Historically, our results of operations have substantially depended upon our ability to be among the first-to-market with new data storage product offerings.Accordingly, we cannot accurately determine the ultimate effect that our new products will have on our results of operations.In addition, the concentration of customers in our largest end markets magnifies the potential effect of missing a product qualification opportunity.We cannot assure you that we will be among the leaders in time-to-market with new products or that we will be able to successfully qualify new products with our customers in the future.The markets for our data storage products are characterized by technological change, which is driven in part by the adoption of new industry standards.Our manufacturing process requires us to make significant product-specific investments in inventory for production at least three to six months in advance.We rely on sole or a limited number of direct and indirect suppliers for some or all of these components that we do not manufacture, including substrates for recording media, read/write heads, ASICs, spindle motors, printed circuit boards, suspension assemblies and NAND flash memory.If our products experience increases in failure rates, are of low quality or are not reliable, customers may reduce their purchases of our products, our factory utilization may decrease and our manufacturing rework and scrap costs and our service and warranty costs may increase.Additionally, we may be unable to produce new products that have higher capacities and more advanced technologies in the volumes and timeframes that are required to meet customer demand.We are transitioning to key areal density recording technologies that use HAMR technology to increase HDD capacities.If our transitions to more advanced technologies, including the transition to HDDs utilizing HAMR technology, require development and production cycles that are longer than anticipated or if we otherwise fail to implement new HDD technologies successfully, we may lose sales and market share, which could significantly harm our financial results.In addition, deterioration in business and economic conditions could exacerbate price erosion and volatility as distributors or retailers lower prices to compensate for lower demand and higher inventory levels.Our ability to grow systems, SSD and Lyve revenues is subject to the following risks: • we may be unable to accurately estimate and predict data center capacity and requirements; • we may be unable to offer compelling solutions or services to enterprises, subscribers, or consumers; • we may be unable to obtain cost effective supply of NAND flash memory in order to offer competitive SSD solutions; and • our cloud systems revenues generally have a longer sales cycle, and growth is likely to depend on relatively large customer orders, which may increase the variability of our results of operations and the difficulty of matching revenues with expenses.If there are any technical issues in the supplier’ s technology, it may also cause us to delay shipments of our new technology deployments and harm our financial position.If our direct and indirect vendors for these components are unable to meet our cost, quality, supply and transportation requirements or fulfill their contractual commitments and obligations, we may have to reengineer some products, which would likely cause production and shipment delays, make the reengineered products more costly and provide us with a lower rate of return on these products.If one of our counterparties becomes insolvent or files for bankruptcy, our ability to recover any losses suffered as a result of that counterparty's default may be limited by the liquidity of the counterparty or the applicable laws governing the bankruptcy proceedings.Such events may decrease demand for our products, make it difficult or impossible for us to make and deliver products to our customers or to receive components from our direct and indirect suppliers, and create delays and inefficiencies in our supply chain.This in turn could require us to materially increase prices to our customers which may reduce demand, or, if we are unable to increase prices to adequately address any tariffs, quotas or duties, could lower our margin on products sold and negatively impact our financial performance.Product development expenses decreased by $9 million in the March 2023 quarter compared to the December 2022 quarter primarily due to a $7 million decrease in compensation and other employee benefits from the reduction in headcount as a result of our October 2022 restructuring plan and a $2 million decrease in materials expense.Product development expenses decreased by $42 million in the March 2023 quarter compared to the March 2022 quarter primarily due to a $17 million decrease in variable compensation and related benefit expense, a $16 million decrease in compensation and other employee benefits from the reduction in headcount as a result of our October 2022 restructuring plan and a $6 million decrease in materials expense.Marketing and administrative expenses decreased by $2 million in the March 2023 quarter compared to the December 2022 quarter primarily due to a $5 million decrease in compensation and other employee benefits primarily from the reduction in headcount as a result of our October 2022 restructuring plan and a $3 million decrease in outside services expense, partially offset by a $7 million recovery in December 2022 quarter of an accounts receivable previously written-off in prior year.Marketing and administrative expenses decreased by $18 million in the March 2023 quarter compared to the March 2022 quarter primarily due to a $10 million decrease in variable compensation and related benefit expense, a $4 million decrease compensation and other employee benefits primarily from the reduction in headcount as a result of our October 2022 restructuring plan and a $3 million decrease in outside services expense.The CAMT is effective for us beginning in fiscal year 2024.Revenue in the March 2023 quarter decreased by $27 million from the December 2022 quarter primarily due to price erosion, partially offset by an increase in mass capacity exabytes shipped and higher demand for our non-HDD products.We generated revenue of approximately $1.9 billion with a gross margin of 17%.In connection to this expansion of the October 2022 Plan, we incurred additional employee termination costs and accelerated depreciation of certain capital equipment that would not be utilized as part of our operations.Purchase obligations Purchase obligations are defined as contractual obligations for the purchase of goods or services, which are enforceable and legally binding on us, and that specify all significant terms.Consequently, we will continue to evaluate our financial position in light of future developments, particularly those relating to the global economic factors and the pandemic.These reductions in demand have required us to reduce manufacturing production plans and recognize manufacturing underutilization charges.As part of the Settlement Agreement with BIS, quarterly payments of $15 million will be made over the course of five years beginning October 31, 2023, of which $30 million is expected to be paid within one year and $270 million thereafter.
