Our inventory management is complex, as we continue to sell a significant mix of products through distributors.European sales are often weaker during the summer months.The following information should be particularly read in conjunction with Part I, Item I,“ Business” and Part II, Item 7,“ Management’ s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” and the Consolidated Financial Statements and related notes in Part II, Item 8,“ Financial Statements and Supplementary Data” of this Form 10-K. The risks we describe in this Form 10-K or in our other SEC filings or additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we currently believe to be immaterial could, in ways we may not be able to accurately predict, recognize or control, have a material adverse effect on our business, reputation, financial position, results of operations, cash flows and stock price, and they could cause our future results to be materially different than we presently anticipate.Furthermore, non-original supplies (including imitation, refill or remanufactured alternatives), which are often available at lower prices, compete with our Printing Supplies business and we may not be able to prevent the use of imitation print supplies with our printers using technological protection measures.The performance of single-source suppliers under those agreements (and the renewal or extension of those agreements upon similar terms) may affect the quality, quantity and price of our components.Such disruptions could adversely impact our ability to fulfill orders and respond to customer requests and interrupt other processes, resulting in delayed sales, lower margins, lost customers or reputational damage.Further, changes in our management team may be disruptive to our business, and we may be unable to successfully transition and assimilate key new hires or promoted employees or successfully execute succession plans.Although historically we have announced regular cash dividend payments and we have adopted a share repurchase program, we are not obligated to pay cash dividends or to repurchase a specified number or dollar value of shares under our share repurchase program or at all.Because the availability and cost of licenses from third parties depends upon the willingness of third parties to deal with us on the terms we request, there is a risk that third parties who license to our competitors will either refuse to license to us or refuse to license to us on terms equally favorable to those granted to our competitors.For example, in part due to ongoing economic uncertainty, we observed a decline in consumer demand beginning in the third quarter of fiscal 2022, particularly with respect to Consumer PCs.In addition, if we cannot proportionately decrease our cost structure on a timely basis in response to competitive price pressures, our gross margin, profitability and cash flows could be adversely affected.We also obtain many Printing components from single 35 Table of ContentsHP INC.Printer unit volume decreased 15.4% and ASPs increased 10.4%.Provision for taxesOur effective tax rate was 27.9% in fiscal year 2022.Fiscal year 2022 compared with fiscal year 2021 Personal Systems net revenue increased 1.7% (increased 3.6% on a constant currency basis) in the fiscal year 2022, as compared to the prior-year period.Operating expenses as a percentage of revenue decreased by 0.8 percentage points primarily driven by last year’ s increased R & D investments, lower variable compensation and joint partner funding.Fiscal year 2022 compared with fiscal year 2021 Printing net revenue decreased 6.1% (decreased 5.5% on a constant currency basis) for fiscal year 2022 as compared to the prior-year period.We expect to make future cash payments of $0.4 billion in fiscal year 2023 with remaining cash payments through fiscal year 2025.For the fiscal year 2022, we continued to see strong demand in Windows-based Commercial PCs, and mix shifts from low end to premium products.AND SUBSIDIARIES Management’ s Discussion and Analysis ofFinancial Condition and Results of OperationsWe typically experience higher net revenues in our fourth fiscal quarter compared to other quarters in our fiscal year due, in part, to seasonal holiday demand.Acquisition and divestiture charges increased by $250 million in the fiscal year 2022, primarily due to the Poly acquisition.Amortization of Intangible assets increased by $74 million in the fiscal year 2022, primarily due to the recent acquisition of Poly, and the acquisitions of HyperX and Teradici in the fiscal year 2021.Russia exit chargesFor the fiscal year 2022, HP recognized a charge of $23 million towards severance, cancellation of contracts, inventory write-downs and other one-time exit charges related to our decision to wind down our operations in Russia.Interest and other, netInterest and other, net for the fiscal year 2022 was net expense as compared to a net gain in the fiscal year 2021, primarily due to one-time gain from Oracle litigation proceeds of $2.3 billion in the prior-year period and increased interest expenses on senior unsecured notes.Corporate InvestmentsThe loss from operations in Corporate Investments for the fiscal year 2022 was primarily due to expenses associated with our incubation projects and investments in digital enablement.
