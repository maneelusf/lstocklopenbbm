We expect that international sales will continue to account for a substantial majority of our total revenue in future years.INDUSTRY AND CUSTOMER RISKSThe Semiconductor Capital Equipment Industry Is Subject to Variability and Periods of Rapid Growth or Decline; We Therefore Face Risks Related to Our Strategic Resource Allocation DecisionsThe semiconductor capital equipment industry has historically been characterized by rapid changes in demand.If We Choose to Acquire or Dispose of Businesses, Product Lines, and Technologies, We May Encounter Unforeseen Costs and Difficulties That Could Impair Our Financial PerformanceAn important element of our management strategy is to review acquisition prospects that would complement our existing products, augment our market coverage and distribution ability, enhance our technological capabilities, or accomplish other strategic objectives.In addition, the emergence of“ big data” and new tools such as machine learning and artificial intelligence that capitalize on the availability of large data sets is leading semiconductor manufacturers and equipment manufacturers to pursue new products and approaches that exploit those tools to advance technology development.Results of Operations of this quarterly report on Form 10-Q, accounted for approximately 91%, 92%, and 94% of total revenue in the nine months ended March 26, 2023 and fiscal years 2022, and 2021, respectively.Protecting our key proprietary technology helps us achieve our goals of developing technological expertise and new products and systems that give us a competitive advantage; increasing market penetration and growth of our installed base; and providing comprehensive support and service to our customers.Revenue in China, which includes global customers and domestic Chinese customers with manufacturing facilities in China, represented approximately 26%, 31%, and 35% of our total revenue for the nine months ended March 26, 2023 and fiscal years 2022 and 2021, respectively.As a result of these risk factors, as well as other risks discussed in our other SEC filings, our actual results could differ materially from those projected in any forward-looking statements.Any such inabilities or inadequacies could have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results, financial condition, and/or cash flows.In addition, any acquisition could result in changes such as potentially dilutive issuances of equity securities, the incurrence of debt and contingent liabilities, the amortization of related intangible assets, and goodwill impairment charges, any of which could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows, and/or the price of our Common Stock.We May Incur Impairments to Goodwill or Long-lived AssetsWe review our goodwill identified in business combinations for impairment annually or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of these assets may exceed the fair value.We operate in a highly competitive environment and projections of future operating results and cash flows may vary significantly from actual results.A reduction or suspension in our dividend payments or share repurchases could have a negative effect on the price of our Common Stock.Foreign exchange fluctuations were primarily due to currency movements against portions of our unhedged balance sheet exposures for all periods presented.Restructuring Charges, NetIn the three and nine months ended March 26, 2023, we initiated a restructuring plan designed to better align our cost structure with our outlook for the economic environment and business opportunities.Certain, but not all, of the forward-looking statements in this report are specifically identified as forward-looking, by use of phrases and words such as“ believe,”“ estimated,”“ anticipate,”“ expect,”“ probable,”“ intend,”“ plan,”“ aim,”“ may,”“ should,”“ could,”“ would,”“ will,”“ continue,” and other future-oriented terms.We did, however, continue to see improvement in supply chain constraints and were able to fulfill shipments of nearly all our outstanding back order systems.We aim to balance the requirements of our customers with the availability of resources, as well as performance to our operational and financial objectives.In the longer term, liquidity will depend to a great extent on our future revenues and our ability to appropriately manage our costs based on demand for our products and services.Anticipated cash flows from operations based on our current business outlook, combined with our current levels of cash, cash equivalents, and short-term investments as of March 26, 2023, are expected to be sufficient to support our anticipated levels of operations, investments, debt service requirements, capital expenditures, capital redistributions, and dividends through at least the next twelve months.Our core technical competency is integrating hardware, process, materials, software, and process control, enabling results on the wafer.Our Customer Support Business Group provides products and services to maximize installed equipment performance, predictability, and operational efficiency.We have built a strong global presence with core competencies in areas like nanoscale applications enablement, chemistry, plasma and fluidics, advanced systems engineering and a broad range of operational disciplines.Our customer base includes leading semiconductor memory, foundry, and integrated device manufacturers that make products such as non-volatile memory, dynamic random-access memory, and logic devices.
