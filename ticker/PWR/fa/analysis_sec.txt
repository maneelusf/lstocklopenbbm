Under standard terms in the surety market, sureties issue or continue bonds on a project-by-project basis and can decline to issue bonds at any time or require the posting of additional collateral as a condition to issuing or renewing bonds.For example, during 2022, we recorded a $91.5 million impairment in connection with our investment in Starry Group Holdings, Inc. (Starry).For example, recent supply chain and logistical challenges resulting from the U. S. Department of Commerce’ s investigation into an antidumping and countervailing duties circumvention claim on solar cells and panels supplied from Malaysia, Vietnam, Thailand and Cambodia, as well as other sourcing restrictions, have caused disruption in the solar panel supply chain and created delays in the timing of development and/or financing of certain renewable energy projects.For example, supply chain and logistical challenges resulting from the U. S. Department of Commerce’ s investigation into an antidumping and countervailing duties circumvention claim on solar cells and panels supplied from Malaysia, Vietnam, Thailand and Cambodia, as well as other sourcing restrictions, caused disruption in the solar panel supply chain during 2022 and adversely impacted the timing of development and/or financing of certain renewable energy projects, which in turn had a negative impact on the financial performance of our Renewable Energy Infrastructure Solutions segment.Further, special funding and operational rules are generally applicable to multiemployer plans that are classified as“ endangered,”“ seriously endangered” or“ critical” status based on multiple factors (including, for example, the plan’ s funded percentage, cash flow position and a projected minimum funding deficiency).In addition, significant judgment is required in determining our worldwide provision for income taxes.Further, in connection with an acquisition, we cannot be certain that we identify all potential environmental liabilities relating to any acquired business when we are negotiating an indemnification right.We also generate a significant portion of our revenues under fixed price contracts, including contracts for projects where we provide EPC services (e. g., large transmission and pipeline projects, facility and terminal projects), and we have strategically expanded these service offerings in recent years, including with respect to renewable energy projects through our acquisition of Blattner.Furthermore, certain of our customers operate energy-and communications-related infrastructure assets in locations and environments that increase the likelihood and/or severity of these operational hazards, including as a result of changes in climate and other factors in recent years.PG & E, SCE and certain other customers have been determined to be or are potentially responsible for catastrophic wildfire events that have occurred in recent years.We also often perform services in locations that are densely populated and that have higher value property and assets, such as California and metropolitan areas, which can increase the impact of any of these hazards or other accidents.Our exposure to liability can also extend for years after we complete our services, and potential claims and liabilities arising from significant accidents and events can take years and significant legal costs to resolve.For example, due to the increased occurrence and future risk of wildfires in California and other areas in the western United States, Australia and other locations, insurers have reduced coverage availability and increased the cost of insurance coverage for such events in recent years.The pool of skilled workers in certain of our industries has also been reduced, and may be further reduced, due primarily to an aging utility workforce and longer-term labor availability issues, including with respect to experienced program managers and qualified journeyman linemen available for our Electric Power Infrastructure Solutions segment and experienced supervisors and foremen for our Underground Utility and Infrastructure Solutions segment.Because our projects are often technically complex, our failure to make judgments and recommendations in accordance with applicable professional standards, including engineering standards, could result in damages.Our decentralized organization can also result in our operating companies assuming excessive risk without appropriate guidance from our centralized legal, accounting, safety, tax, treasury, insurance and other functions.We are also exposed to increases in energy prices, particularly fuel prices for our large fleet of vehicles, which have fluctuated significantly since 2020 and could increase over the longer term due to market conditions or future regulatory, legislative and policy changes that result from, among other things, climate change initiatives.A decline in prices, production or the development of resource plays can also negatively impact demand for certain electric power infrastructure services performed in energy-reliant markets, including Canada and Australia.We also subcontract approximately 20% of our services, including pursuant to customer and regulatory requirements, and certain of these subcontractors may develop into a competitor to us on prime contracts with our customers.We pursue certain opportunities in countries that experience government corruption, and in certain circumstances, compliance with these laws may conflict with local customs and practices.We also perform work, including directional drilling, in and around environmentally sensitive areas such as rivers, lakes and wetlands.For example, during 2021 we incurred approximately $2.30 billion of debt to complete our acquisition of Blattner.For additional information, see Note 8 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8.For additional information regarding these liabilities, see Note 6 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8.See Note 8 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8.For additional information regarding these acquisitions, refer to Note 6 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8.Financial Statements and Supplementary Data in Part II of the 2022 Annual Report.(2) Amounts represent undiscounted operating and finance lease obligations as of December 31, 2022.We perform the majority of our services under existing contracts, including MSAs and similar agreements pursuant to which our customers are not committed to specific volumes of our services.Generally, our customers are not contractually committed to specific volumes of services under our MSAs, and most of our contracts can be terminated on short notice even if we are not in default.Interest payments related to our senior credit facility and notes issued under our commercial paper program are not included due to their variable interest rates, and as it relates to the commercial paper program, the short-term nature of the borrowings.Increased revenues and operating income across all our segments during 2022 generated $1.1 billion of cash provided by operating activities, a 94.1% increase relative to 2021, which allowed us to execute our business plan, repurchase $128 million of common stock and pay $41 million of dividends.We expect the strong demand for our services will continue.Additional information with respect to certain of those factors is provided below.This increase was partially offset by approximately $145 million in lower emergency restoration services revenues and foreign exchange impacts of approximately $23 million.These increases were partially offset by foreign exchange impacts of approximately $25 million.These increases were partially offset by foreign exchange impacts of approximately $62 million.Our available commitments under our senior credit facility and cash and cash equivalents as of December 31, 2022 were as follows (in thousands): (1) Represents unsecured notes issued under our commercial paper program, which allows for the issuance of notes up to a maximum aggregate face amount of $1.0 billion outstanding at any time.Partially offsetting these items were $62.1 million of proceeds from the sale of property and equipment and $20.6 million of cash received from sale of investments.These items were partially offset by $49.2 million of proceeds from the sale of property and equipment and $29.1 million of cash received primarily from sale of investments.Financing ActivitiesNet cash used in financing activities in the year ended December 31, 2022 included $127.8 million common stock repurchases; $82.6 million payments to satisfy tax withholding obligations associated with stock-based compensation; $41.1 million of dividends; $23.4 million of net repayments under our senior credit facility and commercial paper program; $15.7 million of net repayments of short-term debt; and $9.7 million of distributions to non-controlling interests.On October 13, 2021, we borrowed the full amount of a $750.0 million term loan facility under our senior credit facility and used such amount, together with the net proceeds from our September 2021 offering of the senior notes and approximately $50.9 million of revolving loans borrowed under our senior credit facility, to pay the cash consideration for the acquisition of Blattner.Net cash provided by financing activities in 2021 was partially offset by $66.7 million of cash payments for common stock repurchases, $65.0 million of cash payments to satisfy tax withholding obligations associated with stock-based compensation and $34.0 million of cash payments for dividends and cash dividend equivalents.
