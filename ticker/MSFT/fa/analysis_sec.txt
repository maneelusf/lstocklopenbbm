Any defects we do not detect and fix in pre-release testing could cause reduced sales and revenue, damage to our reputation, repair or remediation costs, delays in the release of new products or versions, or legal liability.For example, compliance with the 2017 United States Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (“ TCJA”) and possible future legislative changes may require the collection of information not regularly produced within the Company, the use of estimates in our consolidated financial statements, and the exercise of significant judgment in accounting for its provisions.These events could negatively impact our results of operations, financial condition, and reputation.These acquisitions and other transactions and arrangements involve significant challenges and risks, including that they do not advance our business strategy, that we get an unsatisfactory return on our investment, that they raise new compliance-related obligations and challenges, that we have difficulty integrating and retaining new employees, business systems, and technology, that they distract management from our other businesses, or that announced transactions may not be completed.Our business policies and internal security controls may not keep pace with these changes as new threats emerge, or emerging cybersecurity regulations in jurisdictions worldwide.Despite our efforts to protect customer and user data, perceptions that the collection, use, and retention of personal information is not satisfactorily protected could inhibit sales of our products or services and could limit adoption of our cloud-based solutions by consumers, businesses, and government entities.An IoT solution has multiple layers of hardware, sensors, processors, software, and firmware, several of which we may not develop or control.If components are delayed or become unavailable, whether because of supplier capacity constraint, industry shortages, legal or regulatory changes that restrict supply sources, or other reasons, we may not obtain timely replacement supplies, resulting in reduced sales or inadequate datacenter capacity.We are increasingly incorporating open source software into our products.The highest fines assessed under GDPR have recently been increasing, especially against large technology companies.We are regularly under audit by tax authorities in different jurisdictions.36 PART I Item 2 • General and administrative expenses increased $163 million or 11% driven by acquisition-related expenses and investments in corporate functions.Key changes in operating expenses were: • Research and development expenses increased $2.8 billion or 16% driven by investments in cloud engineering and LinkedIn.• General and administrative expenses increased $1.2 billion or 30% driven by employee severance expenses.• Operating expenses increased $1.3 billion or 9% driven by investments in LinkedIn and cloud engineering, as well as employee severance expenses.The increase in our effective tax rate for the nine months ended March 31, 2023 compared to the prior year was primarily due to a $3.3 billion net income tax benefit in the first quarter of fiscal year 2022 related to the transfer of intangible properties and a decrease in tax benefits relating to stock-based compensation.Highlights from the third quarter of fiscal year 2023 compared with the third quarter of fiscal year 2022 included: • Microsoft Cloud revenue increased 22% to $28.5 billion.First, we reduced our overall workforce by approximately 10,000 jobs through the third quarter of fiscal year 2023, which represents less than 5% of our total employee base.Seasonality Our revenue fluctuates quarterly and is generally higher in the second and fourth quarters of our fiscal year.Second quarter revenue is driven by corporate year-end spending trends in our major markets and holiday season spending by consumers, and fourth quarter revenue is driven by the volume of multi-year on-premises contracts executed during the period.Prior year non-GAAP financial measures exclude the net income tax benefit related to transfer of intangible properties in the first quarter of fiscal year 2022.In the first quarter of fiscal year 2022, we transferred certain intangible properties from our Puerto Rico subsidiary to the U. S. The transfer of intangible properties resulted in a $3.3 billion net income tax benefit in the first quarter of fiscal year 2022, as the value of future U. S. tax deductions exceeded the current tax liability from the U. S. global intangible low-taxed income tax.Prior year non-GAAP financial measures exclude the net income tax benefit related to transfer of intangible properties in the first quarter of fiscal year 2022.Cash used in financing decreased $13.1 billion to $32.5 billion for the nine months ended March 31, 2023, mainly due to a $7.4 billion decrease in common stock repurchases and a $7.3 billion decrease in repayments of debt, offset in part by a $1.2 billion increase in dividends paid.Cash used in investing decreased $7.0 billion to $13.5 billion for the nine months ended March 31, 2023, due to a $19.4 billion decrease in cash used for acquisitions of companies, net of cash acquired, and purchases of intangible and other assets, offset in part by a $9.1 billion decrease in cash from net investment purchases, sales, and maturities, a $2.1 billion increase in additions to property and equipment, and a $1.2 billion increase in other investing to facilitate the purchase of components.
