Risks in this section are grouped in the following categories: (1) Risks Related to Geopolitical, Macroeconomic and Industry Factors; (2) Risks Related to Our Business and Operations; (3) Risks Related to Financial and Tax; (4) Risks Related to Legal and Regulatory; and (5) Risks Related to the Proposed Acquisition of Evoqua.Material economic and industry factors impacting our businesses include: (i) the overall strength of, and our customers’ confidence in, local and global macroeconomic conditions; (ii) inflation, (iii) overall strength of industrial, governmental, public and private sector spending; (iv) overall strength of the industrial, residential and commercial real estate markets; (v) federal, state, local and municipal governmental fiscal, trade and procurement laws, regulations and policies, including with respect to domestic content; (vi) the availability of commercial financing for our customers and end-users; and (vii) the degree of funding for our public sector customers, including with respect to water infrastructure investments.Beyond the general risks that we face outside the U. S., our operations in emerging markets are subject to additional risks and uncertainties, including: (i) governments may impose or increase withholding or other taxes on remittances and other payments to us; (ii) governments may seek to nationalize our assets; (iii) governments may impose or increase investment barriers or other restrictions affecting our business; (iv) difficulty in enforcing commercial agreements; (v) challenges collecting receivables, or protecting our intellectual property and other assets; (vi) pressure on the pricing of our products and services; (vii) higher business conduct risks; and (viii) challenges in our ability to attract and retain qualified talent and labor.Outbreaks of epidemics, pandemics, or public health crises could adversely affect, among other things, demand for our products and services; our operations and sales; our supply chain; our research and development capabilities, engineering, design, and manufacturing processes; and other important business activities.Acquisitions involve a number of risks and present financial, managerial and operational challenges, including: diversion of management’ s attention from existing businesses and operations; insufficient internal controls over financial or compliance activities or financial reporting; the failure to realize expected synergies; the assumption of new material risks associated with the acquired businesses; and the loss of key employees of the acquired businesses.Given the global nature of our business, a number of factors may increase our effective tax rates and tax expense, including: • the geographic mix of jurisdictions in which profits are earned and taxed; • the statutory tax rates and tax laws in jurisdictions in which we conduct business; • the resolution of tax issues arising from tax examinations by various tax authorities; and • the valuation of our deferred tax assets and liabilities.Our current or future indebtedness could have adverse consequences to us and our investors, including: • increasing our vulnerability to general adverse economic and industry conditions; • limiting our ability to obtain additional financing or borrow additional funds; • reducing or eliminating our ability to pay future dividends or repurchase our common stock; • limiting our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business and industry; • requiring a substantial portion of our cash flows from operations to make principal and interest payments; • reducing the cash flows available to fund working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions or other investments to grow our business; • increasing the amount of interest expense that we must pay if future borrowings are at variable interest rates, which, as interest rates increase, would result in higher interest expense; and • increasing the risk of a future credit rating downgrade, which could increase future debt costs and limit the availability of debt financing.We expect our U. S. sales in 2023 and beyond to be similar.If the proposed acquisition is consummated, we will issue to Evoqua stockholders shares of our common stock.As of December 31, 2022, our total outstanding indebtedness was $1,880 million as described under“ Liquidity and Capital Resources "and we may incur additional debt in the future.An inability to meet applicable domestic content requirements for U. S. federally funded projects could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition or results of operations.Limitations on frequency availability or the cost of making necessary modifications may preclude us from selling our products in certain countries.Refer to Note 15, "Post-retirement Benefit Plans", of our consolidated financial statements for additional information.We will continue to evaluate goodwill on an annual basis as of the beginning of our fourth quarter and whenever events and changes in circumstances require us to do so.We conduct our annual impairment test as of the first day of the fourth quarter.Approximately $5 million of contributions are expected to be made in the first quarter.This increase was partially offset by weakness in the emerging markets, primarily due to the continued negative impacts from COVID lockdowns in China.The treatment application saw a slight decrease in orders driven by the emerging markets due to declines in China related to COVID impacts, which more than offset modest growth in the U. S. and western Europe.The decrease in interest expense was primarily driven by interest expense incurred during 2021 related to our 4.875% Senior Notes due 2021 that were paid off in October 2021 and interest income related to additional net investment hedges executed in during 2022.Liquidity and Capital ResourcesThe following table summarizes our sources and uses of cash: (a) The decrease in negative impact of foreign exchange as compared to 2021 is primarily due to strengthening of the Euro partially offset by weakening of the Chinese Yuan.▪ "free cash flow" defined as net cash from operating activities, as reported in the Statement of Cash Flows, less capital expenditures.For 2023, we expect organic revenue growth in the high-single-digits.We expect wastewater utilities to remain focused on mission-critical applications in wastewater.For 2023, we expect organic revenue growth in the low-single-digit range.56 The risks around impairment of our assets are included in our risk factor disclosures referenced under“ Item 1A.
