      " Abbott Laboratories has maintained healthy debt levels over the past few years. Some key details:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. The company's total debt to capitalization ratio has been around 32% to 35% from 2022 to 2019, indicating that around one-third of Abbott's capital structure has consisted of debt. This is a reasonable level of debt that provides benefit from leverage without excessively risky. \n",
      "\n",
      "2. Abbott's interest coverage ratio, which measures its ability to service debt, has been over 10x in recent years. This means the company has consistently earned over 10 times the interest costs, indicating a very healthy coverage of debt. In 2022, the interest coverage was 22.3x.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. Abbott's net debt, which is total debt minus cash, has fluctuated but has either been slightly positive or slightly negative in recent years. This indicates the company has had ample cash on hand to cover its debt obligations. In 2021 and 2022, Abbott actually had more cash than debt, resulting in a negative net debt position.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. Abbott has maintained investment grade credit ratings from the major ratings agencies, currently at A+ from Standard & Poor's and A2 from Moody's. This demonstrates that debt investors view the company as having a low risk of default.\n",
      "\n",
      "In summary, Abbott Laboratories has managed its debt levels prudently, with moderate amounts of debt, strong interest coverage, a net cash position at times, and investment grade credit ratings. The data suggests Abbott's debt levels have been healthy and supportive of the company's financial stability and growth.\n"

      " Abbott Laboratories has maintained a relatively high debt level over the past few years. Some key points regarding the company's debt levels:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. Total debt as a percentage of total capitalization has ranged from around 30% to 35% from 2019 to 2022. This indicates that Abbott is around one-third financed through debt.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. The company's total debt increased from $16.6 billion in 2019 to $16.8 billion in 2022. While relatively flat, this still represents a high level of debt in absolute terms. \n",
      "\n",
      "3. Abbott's long-term debt as a percentage of total assets has also hovered around the 20% mark over the past several years. This indicates that the company has financed around one-fifth of its total assets through long-term borrowing. \n",
      "\n",
      "4. The company's interest coverage ratio, which measures its ability to service debt obligations, has been decent but declined slightly from 7.9x in 2019 to 22.3x in 2022. A higher ratio is preferable.\n",
      "\n",
      "5. Abbott's cash flow from operations has consistently covered its interest expense, indicating that operating cash flows are sufficient to meet debt-related obligations.\n",
      "\n",
      "In summary, while Abbott Laboratories maintains decent credit metrics and cash flows to service its debt, the company relies on a relatively high level of debt financing - around one-third of its total capitalization - to fund growth. The company will want to monitor and manage its debt levels closely going forward.\n"
